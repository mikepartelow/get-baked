## Directions

### Day 0: 15 Minutes

1. Remove butter from fridge. Mise en place for next morning.
2. Mix polenta and water in a small bowl. Cover. Let sit overnight at room temperature.

### Day 1: 4.5 Hours

1. Turn on Proofer Box, set to 77F.
2. Prepare Sponge.
    1. In large mixing bowl, mix sponge flour with yeast, Soaker, and water @ 38C.
    2. Place Sponge in Proofer Box.
    3. Ferment Sponge for 60m or until it bubbles.
3. Add remaining flour, salt, molasses, and butter.
4. Stir or mix in mixer until ingredients form a ball.
5. Knead dough on floured surface, or in mixer at medium, about 8-10 minutes in the mixer (setting 2 of 4) or 10 minutes by hand.
6. Add more flour if dough is sticky.
7. When dough absolutely aces (not just "passes") Windowpane Test, stop kneading. 
8. Lightly oil a bowl or dough bucket and add the dough.
9. Note dough temperature and weight. **Desired Dough Temperature:** 77-81F.
10. Ferment in Proofer Box until the dough doubles (60ish min). 🚨🚨 Note initial dough volume 🚨🚨
11. On an **unfloured** surface, gently degass the dough.
12. Divide dough into 2 or 3 pieces. 3 loaves if using USA Pan Smalls, 2 loaves if using Larges.
13. Form into loaves. See BBA page 82 or Artisan Breads Every Day page 23. 🚨🚨 Create/maintain tension in the dough. 🚨🚨
14. Add to loaf pans. 🚨 Dough should touch all edges of pan, not shrink in the middle. 🚨
15. Note dough temperature.
16. 🚨 Preheat oven to 350F, convection bake 🚨
17. Proof loaves in Proofer Box at 77F for at least 60-90m. 
18. Remove loaves from proofer when dough clears the tops of the loaf pans. Not before!
19. 🚨 Perform the poke test 🚨
20. Mist loaves with water, sprinkle cornmeal or polenta on top.
    - Don't under-mist. The mist encourages oven spring.
21. Bake loaves in oven for 20m. 
22. Rotate loaves. Bake another 20-30m, until well browned and internal temperature is at least 185F. 🚨 Don't let it get past 200F. 🚨
23. Remove loaves from oven. Note temperature. Remove loaves from pans and rest on resting rack for 1h.
