## History

### 2025/01/03-04

- ‚ùóÔ∏è Added 80g flour during mixing to reduce stickiness.
- Used different amounts of soaker/dough flour than recipe (same total).

Day 1:
- 0850: Prepare sponge (using 336g flour)
- 0905: Sponge resting
- 1020: Mix dough
- 1024: Dough to mixer (dough hook) on medium (setting #2)
- 1026: Add 80g flour to reduce stickiness
- 1030: Manual kneading to test and pass windowpane
- 1035: To Proofer Box @ 80F. Initial dough temp: 71F. (üö® should have massed the dough at this point!)
- 1205: Fermentation done. Dough mass: 1428.5g. Divided and shaped into three loaves.
- 1215: To Proofer Box @ 85F. Internal dough temp: 73F. (üö® due to user error, proofer was unpowered for 45m!)
- 1344: Remove from proofer. Spray, dust with cornmeal, place loaf pans on a baking sheet.
- 1346: Baking sheet with loaf pans to oven @ 350F.
- 1410: Rotate loaves.
- 1430: Loaves out, on to resting racks.

Total Time: 5h40m (5h30m estimated)
Yield: 1428g/1356g = 105%
Review: Although the loaves are small, the bread is delicious, the crumb is not overly dense, the crust is crackly.

### 2025/01/08-09

Day 1:
    0720: Prepare sponge (243g flour)
    0730: Sponge to proofer @76F
    0846: mix: quick hand mix, then to mixer with dough hook on speed 1
    0846: knead in mixer on setting 2, 6m +1m30s
    0902: passed windowpane test, added only a little flour. internal temp 75F
    0905: to proofer @80F, misted top
    1037: dough has doubled, divided 1366g dough into TWO loaves into two 10x5x3" pans
    1044: dough to proofer @80f, misted tops. Internal dough temp 75F.
    1215: preheat oven to 350F, steam injection enabled (manual mode)
    1240: activated manual steam burst, which adds steam to oven on demand and deactivates after 8-10m
    1251: loaves barely cleared top of pans, misted, dusted, to (steamy) oven
    1300: very little oven spring
    1311: rotate
    1333: out. internal temp 206F

Total Time: 6h13m
    - Knead: 7m30s
    - Bulk: 1h32m
    - Proof: 2h5m
    - Bake: 42m
Yield: 1336g/1356g = 98.5%
Review: fluffier texture and better flavor than previous (which had an off-aftertaste). Crust is soft and separated from crumb.
Next time: 
- Knead longer to more authoritatively pass Windowpane. 
- Degass after fermentation. 
- Spread dough to cover pan.
- Poke test proofing. 
- Inject steam when adding loaf, not before. 
- Bake at 375F, not 350F.

### 2025/01/11-12

Day 1:
- 0815: MEP, prepare sponge. Using SAF-Instant "Premium"
- 0825: Sponge to proofer @80F
- 0925: Mix.
- 0935: knead in bosch compact bread mixer, setting 2, targeting 8m
- 0943: to bench. adjusting flour. windowpane test. fail
- 0947: stretch and fold. 3m rest.
- 0950: stretch and fold. 5m rest.
- 0957: stretch and fold. 3m rest.
- 1000: stretch and fold. windowpane passes.
- 1004: 73F dough internal temp, 1365g dough mass. to proof box @ 80F. also placed loaf pans in proofer.
- 1127: degass, divide dough in half.
- 1136: shaped, large loaf pans, to proofer @80F
- 1302: poke test suggests good/slightly-over proof. misted, dusted, to oven @ 375F. "manual" steam on introduction.
- 1306: steam completed.
- 1323: turn loaves
- 1343: out. internal temp 208. darker than previous loaves (used higher oven temp)

Notes:
- 375F gives better crust than 350
- Unlike last batch, crust did not separate. Intended fix for crust separation was longer gluten development (knead). So presumably that worked, keeping recommendation to knead on #2 for 8+ instead of 6+.
- I am disappointed by the oven spring on this recipe. However, most internet people (with one exception) don't get much oven spring from Anadama bread. And I have no complaints on flavor or texture. It could just be destined to be a stubby loaf.
- Figure out how to get better oven spring.
    - use polenta? internet commentor says this is key.
    - Bulk ferment to 130% of original size, not 200%
    - cooler ferment temps
    - Better loaf shaping, esp. tension!

> I've made a few more loaves of anadama bread, and I think the key is to use coarse cornmeal, which is often labled in the grocery store as polenta. I've found that I have to cook it a bit with boiling water before baking, otherwise it's pretty darned crunchy and unappetizing. But, well made, it's fairly light. I think the smaller the grains, the more the corn interferes with good gluten development. Every time I use regular cornmeal, I get a brick.

### 2025/01/15-16

Day 1:

- 0730: Make sponge
- 0735: sponge to proofer @76
- 0835: mix, knead [ POWER OUTAGE! ] - hand
- 0900: 1440g dough to **unpowered** proofer. dough temp 70F.
- 1000: still no power! 
- 1010: misted loaves, covered, to **unpowered** fridge. dough feels much livelier and stronger than before (could be fooling myself).
- 1520: loaves to proofer @76F
- 1600: oven on to 375F
- 1646: loaves (still cold) to oven. Burst Of Steam. 
- 1701: adjust temp to 350F, open door a little to let out steam
- 1716: rotate loaves
- 1729: loaves out. internal temp 203F. 

Notes:

- Used **polenta** (Bob's Red Mill) instead of "cornmeal": keep using polenta 
- Used **brer rabbit mild** molasses instead of smart & final brand: noticeably better flavor!
- shaped on **unfloured** surface
- power outage!! put loaves in fridge by necessity.
- used too much oil in proofing bucket
- starting to suspect the problem is not "oven spring" but "not enough dough to make the loaf size I want"
    - try: scale up the recipe - 850g of flour
    - try: scale up the yeast (without scaling the flour)
- underproofed, too dense. but best flavor yet

### 2025/01/22-23

Day 1:

- 0736: sponge to proofer @80F
- 0823: mix, hand knead
- 0850: 2060g dough, internal temp 74F to proofer @ 80F
- 1012: shape
- 1018: to proofer @80F, internal temp 72F
- 1118: to oven at 375F, burst of steam
- 1132: adjusted oven to 350F
- 1140: rotate
- 1202: out. internal temp 199F-202F

Notes:
- looking like a proper loaf!!!
- try not to add too much extra flour
- use mixer, hand mixing is very slow
- really need to get better at shaping a loaf
- use convection bake, not bake
- not underbaked, but less dry than usual due to scaleup without additional bake time. delicious as usual.

    - bake at 350F 
    - remove from oven when 190-200F inside, don't wait for 206F


### 2025/02/11

#### Notes
- ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è used 13g yeast (on purpose) ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
- dough is really wet. maybe we don't get desired rise for the same reason ciabatta doesn't rise - consider adding waaaay more flour 
- lack of shaping tension - related to overhydration? - led to slight crust separation
- more open crumb than usual
- better "bread loaf" shape than usual
- again tastes "dry" but no obvious culprit for this since internal temp is lower than usual
- adjusting recipe yeast back down to original 1.1%
- maybe try actual 9x5 pans?

#### Day 1

- 0730: proofer to 75F
- 0740: make sponge
- 0750: sponge to proofer
- 0900: mix
- 0909: to mixer, on speed 1
- 0915: speed 2

- 0931: mixer: speed 2
- 0934: done
- 0938: 2086g dough, 73F internal temp, to proofer @75F. very wet dough today, lots of flour additions, still pretty loose. 1.5L of 6L bucket
- 1041: dough risen to 3.8L
- 1052: loaves to proofer @75F, 10x5 pans. dough is quite developed though before bulk it only weakly passed windowpane.
- 1130: preheat oven 350F, no steam, convection bake
- 1220: loaves in (no steam). cleared the top of the pans by a lot!
- 1242: rotate
