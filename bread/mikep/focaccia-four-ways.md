- 1815: MEP/mix
- 1830: autolyze
- 1905: S+F
- 1950: S+F
- 1040: S+F -> room temp 20.5C

### 2025/08/08

> dough was jiggly, massively bubbly, lots of visible gluten, strong alcohol smell. could easily bake it right away

- 0945: 4 dough blobs, 238g each, to fridge

### 2025/08/10

> dough was very very wet (duh!) not "balls" at all
> dough was very delicate and tore in one place
> could probably use 2-3x more dough for an interesting different result!

- 1505: dough out. room temp 20C
- 1730: dough to oiled pans
- 1735: prepared sauce: garlic, tomatoes, salt, blended
- 1835: turn on oven, 475F "convection bake", stretch dough
- 1945: out after 15m

#### Notes

- dough was overproofed and there was way too little of it to be focaccia, however...
- all excellent, none like focaccia - all "flatbreads"
- rosemary and zatar were cracker-like, esp esges
- all too oily, especially rosemary and zatar
- philly and pizza were very crispy and amazing. both laced edges. 50/50 white cheddar mozz on the pizza
- ðŸš¨ try again doubling or tripling dough
- could make four excellent pizzas with this recipe as-is (but try with more dough to see what that's like)
- crackery crust. philly pie was amazing.
- zatar is half/half **by mass** not by volume
- zatar was least best. too oily. not enough herb blend.
