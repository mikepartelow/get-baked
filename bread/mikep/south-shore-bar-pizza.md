# South Shore Bar Pizza with Laced Edges

> Source: https://barpizzabarpizza.com/recipe/homemade-south-shore-bar-pizza-dough-recipe/

> The trick to achieving that buttery crispy crust is adding Corn oil and melted butter, along with minimal kneading. 

> Once I started using Lloyd pans I no longer had to place the pizza back onto the stone or baking steel to crisp up the bottom. These work great on there own, no stone needed. 

## Ingredients

> Makes four (4) 10" pan pizzas

## History

### 2025/07/30

> Used KAF bread flour

- 2045: melt butter, MEP
- 2102: knead on #2 for 2m
- 2108: dough mass: 771g
- 2120: 4 boules 192g to fridge

### 2025/08/01

> Not much visible rise in the dough
> blended the sauce

- 1700: dough out
- 1810: oven to "bake", 500F, steel on center rack
- 1920: 4 pizzas in
- 1932: set to convectio broil 500F
- 1936: out. top two very well browned

### Notes

- all pizzas good
- LACED EDGES RULE
- not crispy on the bottom. crispy on the sides, esp where laced cheese
- ones cooked on steel, under broiler, were noticeably best
- can take a lot of sauce, don't be shy, heavy sauce makes better pizza
- 4 people -> no leftovers!

### Next Time

- cook two at a time
- use plenty of sauce
- white cheddar is delicious
- lace both sauce and cheese
- try one with sauce on top
- !! use AP flour
- some day: bake last 2 minutes on stone, out of pan

> ChatGPT says:
> If you ever want to crank up crispiness:
> Swap the butter for more corn oil or a neutral oil (keep total fat at ~10–12%).
> Push hydration to 58–60% if you're using a hotter oven or pizza steel, as it’ll evaporate fast and can handle the > boost.
