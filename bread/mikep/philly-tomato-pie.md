## Directions

### Day 0: 50m-90m

#### Make Sauce

> ⚠️ It's best to make sauce on the same day as the dough. Both will improve with nights in the fridge.

1. Blend tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and salt until smooth
2. Heat 2Tbsp olive oil in a large pan. 
3. Add blended sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half: 30-40m
4. Final sauce should be thick like tomato paste, brick-red, and you'll see bottom of the pan when dragging a spoon through.

#### Make Dough

> Use a spatula to stretch and fold. Don't imagine hands will be better.

0. In a very large mixing bowl, mix dry ingredients.
1. Add water. Slowly mix until dough is coarse and sticky, but not lumpy.
2. Add olive oil. Mix.
3. Cover, let hydrate for 10 minutes. 🚨 Now is a good time to make sauce!
4. Stretch and fold.
5. Cover bowl, let sit 10-20 minutes.
6. Stretch and fold.
7. Cover bowl, let sit 10-20 minutes.
8. Stretch and fold.
9. Cover bowl, let sit 10-20 minutes.
10. Stretch and fold.
11. Oil a 6L cambro. Add dough top side down and cover with oil. Flip and cover other side with oil.
12. Cover cambro, put into fridge overnight.

### Day 1: Bake Day : 140 minutes

#### Brine

- 100g water
- 10g salt

> Use pizza steel on center rack

0. Remove sauce from oven, reheat to lukewarm.
1. Remove dough from fridge 2 hours prior to shaping
2. Grate pecornio or parmesan
2. Spread 3/8 cups of olive oil over a grandma or half sheet pan.
3. Remove dough from container
4. GENTLY jiggle-stretch it in the pan, pressing towards corners.
5. Cover, let rest 45 minutes.
6. Jiggle-stretch again towards corners. Cover.
7. 🚨 Preheat oven to 475F "convection bake" 🚨 with steel 🚨 on center rack 🚨
8. Let dough rest 20 minutes, and 🚨 prepare brine.
9. Drizzle brine over dough.
10. Let dough rest 20m, or longer, until bubbly
11. GENTLY spread **half** the sauce over the dough
12. Bake for 20m, until edges are golden brown and top begins to caramelize. Look for dark blistered spots and a very dark red tomato sauce.
13. Remove pie from oven. 
14. Rest in pan for 2 minutes.
15. Transfer to cooling rack.
16. Top with remaining sauce, drizzle of olive oil, dried oregano, and plenty of grated pecorino or parmesan.



## History

### 2025/07/14-16

#### Day 0

- 2050: MEP/mix
- 2120: S+F
- 2130: S+F
- 2141: S+F
- 2200: S+F, to 6l cambro

#### Day 1

- 1220: dough and sauce out
- 1310: preheat oven 475F convection bake. low heat the sauce. jiggle-stretch dough.
- 1340: drizzled some but not much brine
- 1407: sauced, into oven. sauce was hot when applied. also a bit watery
- 1422: rotate
- 1428: out


### Notes

- dough seemed much drier than 80%
- sauce took at least 1.5h to thicken
- sauce was hot when applied, also a bit watery.
- garlic was not well blended
- lots of blackendness - maybe try 450F next time - actually no, it's perfect
- crispy bottom (corners esp)
- delicious sweet topping
- could upskill on handling and have huge bubbles. really delicious!
- not very salty, could use more brine
- really outstanding: chewy crumb with gummy/crispy crust. delicious sauce.
- did only a few slices with the second layer of sauce. both styles were outstanding. second layer was best, especially next day.
- underwhelming holes
- burnt sauce was delicious
- kind of an absurd amount of olive oil in the dough

### Next Time

- optimize for focaccia-hole crumb
- more brine. use spray bottle
- sauce to edges to get more burnt bottoms
- try part with more oregano
- second coating (post-oven) of sauce is delicious, don't skip it
- pastier sauce : strain tomatoes before making sauce

you can leave the very corners (about the size of a quarter) unoiled and when you later spread the dough to fill the pan, it will stick just in these areas, which will help it keep it’s shape.

### Some Day
- try strained fire roasted in clumps like grandma pizza
- try 64% hydration dough
- try phased application of baked sauce: 0-7m no sauce, 7-14m covered with half the sauce, 15-21 covered with the rest of sauce
- try "laced" edges - sauce right up to the pan edge
