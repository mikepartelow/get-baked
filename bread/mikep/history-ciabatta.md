### Notes

- arguably baked upside-down - kinda smooth on top
- delicious, enormous holes, great texture, all around great results
- maybe too salty
- too open. excellent out of the oven, but less great for dinner.
- the recipe as baked: 1kg dough, 90% water, 2.6% salt, .7% yeast, 450F.

### Day 0

> on first S+F, ingredients were not well mixed. adjusted recipe.

- 1900: MEP/mix
- 1913: cover, 10m rest
- 1923: S+F
- 1933: S+F
- 1943: S+F
- 1955: S+F
- 2005: S+F, to fridge

ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ oops! once scaled to 1.3kg, this recipe is too big to proof in 9x9" square container! it rose up to hit the lid.
ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ 1830 04/27: transferred to a 6L cambro, stretched and folded into boule. 6L is too big, 4L likely would have been fine.

### Day 1

- 1520: dough out, oven on: 475F, convection + steam
- 1610: shape dough, 2 loaves. proof on peels.
- 1635: first loaf in. burst of steam.
- 1652: first loaf out, 208F internal temp
- 1658: second loaf in. burst of steam
- 1718: second loaf out, 22m. 209F internal temp. crackling crust. very dark in areas lacking flour. looks great.

### Notes

- because it was in a round cambro the dough was hard to square.
- very very bubbly dough!
- massive oven spring (475F seems better than 450F)
- recipe as baked: 
| Flour      | 710g    | 100   |
| Water      | 568g    | 80    |
| Salt       | 14.2g   | 2     |
| I Yeast    | 5g      | .7    |
| **Total**  | 1297g   | 183   |
- first loaf creamy, crust is crispy but not VERY crispy. huge holes.
- crust is a little too leathery. 
- second loaf: holes too big. crumb a little too dry.

### Next Time:

- more tension while shaping 
- for second loaf, more folding and flipping to reduce oversized holes. try reinhart's envelope
- full browning
- that's it!
