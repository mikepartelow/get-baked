## Directions

### Day 0: 5-7h

1. mix flour, yeast, and water until combined.
2. Cover
3. Autolyse 45â€“60 min for better gluten development.
4. add salt and olive oil, mix until fully incorporated.
5. S+F
6. Cover and wait 30-45 minutes
7. S+F
8. Cover and wait 30-45 minutes

10. Cover and wait 2-4 hours, until dough has risen 75% and is bubbly.
11. Divide into four balls
12. Put into oiled containers, cover tightly
13. Rest in fridge 24-48 hours

### Day 1: 6 hours

> Sauce: garlic (3-6 cloves per small can of tomatoes), tomatoes, salt (1/2tsp per small can of tomatoes). Blend, reduce over heat. Apply warm. 1 small can works for 2 10" pies as long as one of them is sparse.
> Cheese blend: 50% mozzarella, 25% white cheddar, 25% a different white cheddar
> Zatar paste: by mass, 50/50 olive oil and zatar blend. Consider less oil.
> Focaccia: prepare oiled (so it doesn't burn) rosemary, thyme, black pepper, and a half pinch of flaky salt.
> Grated pecorino or parmesan for Tomato pie

1. Remove dough from fridge 4-5 h before bake time, then immediately...
2. Lightly oil pans - they don't need much, but not too little either
3. Put dough in pans
4. Lightly press dough outward, don't be aggressive, don't bulk in the middle
5. Cover and wait 30-45 minutes
6. Lightly press dough outward, don't be aggressive, don't bulk in the middle
7. Cover and wait 1 hour
8. Prepare to make sauce
9. Turn oven on to 475F convection bake
10. Wait another hour or until dough is risen to about 75% of pan height
9. Make sauce
10. After dough is risen, for focaccia, dimple, oil, add toppings. For pizza or tomato pie, sauce to edges for laced edges. For pizza, top sauce with blend of mozzarella and white cheddar. For zatar bread, top with Zatar paste.
11. Bake 15-20m. Consider reducing to 425F after about 8 minutes.
12. When finished, set on a cooling rack, still in pans
13. For pizza and philly pie, slice immediately while hot to prevent self-steaming and preserve crisp edges
14. For Focaccia and zatar, rest 5m before slicing to absorb oil and set crumb

### History

#### 2025/08/13

- 1445: MEP/mix
- 1500: autolyze
- 1600: finish mixing. forgot to cover during autolyze, added a bit more water.
- 1600: S+F
- 1630: S+F
- 1705: S+F
- 2030: divide into four x 421g
- 2040: to fridge

#### 2025/08/15

- 1500: dough out, into pans. very bubbly, somewhat jiggly, seems lively and will definitely fill if not overfill the pan.
- 1605: shape a little
- 1800: oven on covection bake 475F. steel on bottom rack, shelf on middle rack. dough looks great. made sauce. 
- 1830: put the steel in! ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ i forgot!
- 1915: pizzas in. one tomato pie, one cheese, one chunky sparse sauce with half turkey pep, one pancetta/mushrooms/castlevetrano. not enough philly sauce to go around, not enouch cheese to be excessive. dough very focaccia-like
- 1922: dropped temp to 425F

#### Next Time

- use garlic paste instead of whole garlic to make sauce. blending oxidizes the tomatoes and changes their color for the worse. 
- use TWO large tomato cans, 1.5 is insufficient
- for three pizzas, use 1lb mozz to same volume white cheddar
- deeper dish! less pizza-like than focaccia-like, although the holes were not especially big
- bake 450F, maybe even no convection. the pizzas browned on top much too quickly to cook inside, much less crisp up. some dough was a little underbaked
- much much less sauce on the philly
- with too much dough, we didn't get lacing
- too much garlic in the sauce!
- the dough was very tasty and well behaved, and would make a great focaccia or philly pie in a half sheet
