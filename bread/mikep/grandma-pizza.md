## History

### 2025/05/28-30

#### Day 0

- 2015: MEP/mix
- 2030: rest 30m
- 2105: rest 30m after knead
- 2145: 2 boules to fridge in 4L cambros

#### Day 1

> sauce: 1 bianco di napioli crushed, one muir glen fire roasted crushed, both strained, 1tsp salt, 1Tsbp honey
> second pizza had pepperoni all over and mushrooms on half
> coarse/long grated trader joe's pecorino

- 1705: dough out
- 1805: stretched again. oven on 450F convection bake, steel on bottom shelf

- ðŸš¨ Rest on a rack after baking! ðŸš¨

#### Notes

- first pizza was perfect, crispy crust, detroit burnt cheese
- second pizza was great but not as crispy. maybe steel didn't reheat enough?
- sauce was great
- dough was better at this proportion
- used 2 trader joe's skim mozz plus 1/3 trader joe's full fat mozz
- dough did not reach corners

#### Next Time

- ðŸš¨ crank heat and let steel warm up 10m between pizzas ðŸš¨
- ðŸš¨ lower heat back to normal for second pizza ðŸš¨
- ensure enough oil in second pan
- powder grated pecorino not stringy
- use a whole clove of garlic, or more
- the dough could be scaled up even more
- think about par-baking the crust before topping!

### 2025/06/19-21

### Day 0

- 2015: MEP/mix
- 2030: rest
- 2145: 2 boules to frdige, 790g

### Day 1

> Oven Config: steel on sliding rack on bottom shelf, #1. Stone on fixed rack on 3rd from bottom shelf, #3.

- 1700: dough out
- 1710: 45m rest
- 1815: both pizzas in. top pizza: mushroom and turkey pep, plus layered mix of muir glen crushed fire roasted and la valle DOP San Marzano. bottom pizza: half turkey pep, half cheese, tons of garlic, bianco di napoli crushed fire roasted chopped. both sauces had 1 tsp salt and 1 Tbsp honey.


### Notes:

- baked two at once: LIGHT crisp on the bottom, good crisp on the edges. MAYBE cranking heat could properly crisp both bottoms, or maybe an extra steel. Also loaded them down with TONS of cheese and sauce, that probably didn't help much for crisp
- both were super delicious, but maybe not the best ever
- the crust/convenience tradeoff may be worth it
- might be able to crisp both by using less dough and making a thinner crust - but the thicker crust is great
- detroit-style cheese edges worked well and are delicious
- more oven spring than usual, very tall crust
- best recipe yet for cold pizza at 1 and 2 days in fridge
