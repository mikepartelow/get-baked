## History

### 2025/02/04-06

> 2 "mini"-Ciabatta 

#### Day 0

- 2025: MEP
- 2035: mix
- 2040: to proofer @75F, 1312g
- 2051: S+F
- 2101: S+F
- 2012: S+F
- 2022: S+F, to fridge, slightly over 1L

#### Day 1

- 1000: to proofer (not preheated) @75F
- 1100: halve, shape
- 1115: to proofer @75F
- 1210: preheat oven to 500F "surround" mode plus steam
- 1210: shaped. dough stuck to parchment paper, had to cut it off gently with scraper. 
- 1215: proofing on floured parchment paper on peel, covered with cheesecloth, at room temp, 68F
- 1300: to oven, steam
- 1306: steam over, dropped temp to 475F, let out some steam
- 1313: rotate loaves
- 1324: loaves out, 22m bake time, 208F internal temp. 

#### Notes

- dough stuck to parchment paper, had to cut it off gently with scraper. 
- chose to second proof on peel at room temp instead of in proofer
- forgot to lower temp before putting in
- kind of crowded on stone, but worked out fine
- browner than "golden brown"
- nice, open crumb - could be more open if:
    - hadn't stuck to parchment
    - had side support during proofing (to expand more up, less out)
    - maybe had side support during baking?
    - hadn't had so much handling during shaping
- delicious, wonderful texture. outstanding toast. 
- second day seemed a little dried out



### Next Time

#### Goals

- more open crumb
    - no parchment paper that sticks
    - longer second proof (full hour)
    - support sides during proof
    - for one loaf, don't fold or flip, just shape into rectangle
- longer shelf life
    - out after 20m
