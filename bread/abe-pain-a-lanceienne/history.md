## History

### 2025/01/27-29

#### Day 0

- 1500: MEP. Water @52F
- 1516: to proofer @75F. internal temp 61F
- 1526: S+F
- 1537: S+F
- 1548: S+F
- 1600: S+F. dough to fridge. dough mass: 1043g

#### Day 1 (2025/01/29)

> Baguettes

- 1320: dough to proofer @75F
- 1410: dough to bench
- 1425: to oven @525
- 1427: burst of steam
- 1432: space them out and cut the stuck ones apart
- 1439: out after 14m
- 1443: second batch in @500F, burst of steam
- 1457: done


Notes:
- too cramped, no more than 4 per batch
- forget the fancy magic peel, semolina plus regular peel works fine
- scale recipe up 25%. 567g flour is 1.5 batches at most.
- seems a little too moist, and uneven/over-browning. to bake longer, would need lower temp, so set to 500F, not 525F
- used non-convection mode. try convection for an even browning
- first batch had amazing holes, great flavor, wonderful chewey crumb, crispy crust when warm, almost too-moist inside, maybe too salty, and when cooled, maybe too-leathery crust.
- second batch was not as open but no less delicious or chewy. softer crust when cooled, lending credence to the idea of cooking at lower temp (second batch was cooked closer to 500F, first closer to 525F)


### 2025/02/04-06

> 2 "mini"-Ciabatta 

#### Day 0

- 2025: MEP
- 2035: mix
- 2040: to proofer @75F, 1312g
- 2051: S+F
- 2101: S+F
- 2012: S+F
- 2022: S+F, to fridge, slightly over 1L

#### Day 1

- 1000: to proofer (not preheated) @75F
- 1100: halve, shape
- 1115: to proofer @75F
- 1210: preheat oven to 500F "surround" mode plus steam
- 1210: shaped. dough stuck to parchment paper, had to cut it off gently with scraper. 
- 1215: proofing on floured parchment paper on peel, covered with cheesecloth, at room temp, 68F
- 1300: to oven, steam
- 1306: steam over, dropped temp to 475F, let out some steam
- 1313: rotate loaves
- 1324: loaves out, 22m bake time, 208F internal temp. 

#### Notes

- dough stuck to parchment paper, had to cut it off gently with scraper. 
- chose to second proof on peel at room temp instead of in proofer
- forgot to lower temp before putting in
- kind of crowded on stone, but worked out fine
- browner than "golden brown"
- nice, open crumb - could be more open if:
    - hadn't stuck to parchment
    - had side support during proofing (to expand more up, less out)
    - maybe had side support during baking?
    - hadn't had so much handling during shaping
- delicious, wonderful texture. outstanding toast. 
- second day seemed a little dried out



### Next Time

#### Goals

- more open crumb
    - no parchment paper that sticks
    - longer second proof (full hour)
    - support sides during proof
    - for one loaf, don't fold or flip, just shape into rectangle
- longer shelf life
    - out after 20m

### 2025/02/17-19

> Focaccia!

#### Notes

- Used KAF Italian-Style flour (but not the focaccia recipe on the back of the bag!)
- Stuck to sides of bulk bucket.
- Stuck to covering wrap during proofing
- Did not rise much during proof or bake


#### Day 0

1650: MEP/mix
1709: to proofer at 75F. Almost a batter, way looser than when using KAF bread flour.
1718: S+F
1730: S+F. still a loose mess, not a dough
1740: S+F
1756: S+F
1800: to fridge. a little over 1L in 4L bucket. way too loose to really S+F, form into a ball, or easily weigh.

#### Day 1

0805: Out, to 13x18x.75" pan. Filled the whole pan easily. Very flat. Very loose.
0845: oil, dimple. used herb oil. covered with another sheet pan since dough was sticking to bee wax paper
0915: dimple
1015: dimple. dough is chilly, slack, and not very tall
1130: oven on, 500F, "bake" without convection
1200: topped with rosemary
1220: lowered oven to 420F "convection bake", focaccia in. seems not very risen.
1232: rotate
1248: out

#### Next Time (Focaccia)

- Use bread flour - strength for rise. This is likely the main issue to address.
- Use steam. Other main issue.
- Use less olive oil on top to promote browning/rise.
- use 450F convection bake
- Use oven proofing mode for day 1 - let it rise a lot
- Use different pan: less wide/long, more tall
