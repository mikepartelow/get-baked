## History

### 2025/01/27-29

#### Day 0

- 1500: MEP. Water @52F
- 1516: to proofer @75F. internal temp 61F
- 1526: S+F
- 1537: S+F
- 1548: S+F
- 1600: S+F. dough to fridge. dough mass: 1043g

#### Day 1 (2025/01/29)

> Baguettes

- 1320: dough to proofer @75F
- 1410: dough to bench
- 1425: to oven @525
- 1427: burst of steam
- 1432: space them out and cut the stuck ones apart
- 1439: out after 14m
- 1443: second batch in @500F, burst of steam
- 1457: done


Notes:
- too cramped, no more than 4 per batch
- forget the fancy magic peel, semolina plus regular peel works fine
- scale recipe up 25%. 567g flour is 1.5 batches at most.
- seems a little too moist, and uneven/over-browning. to bake longer, would need lower temp, so set to 500F, not 525F
- used non-convection mode. try convection for an even browning
- first batch had amazing holes, great flavor, wonderful chewey crumb, crispy crust when warm, almost too-moist inside, maybe too salty, and when cooled, maybe too-leathery crust.
- second batch was not as open but no less delicious or chewy. softer crust when cooled, lending credence to the idea of cooking at lower temp (second batch was cooked closer to 500F, first closer to 525F)
