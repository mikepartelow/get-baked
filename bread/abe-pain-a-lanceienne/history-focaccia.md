## History

### 2025/02/17-19

> Focaccia!

#### Notes

- 🚨 Used KAF Italian-Style flour (but not the focaccia recipe on the back of the bag!)
    - This was likely a mistake! At least, not without adding extra flour.
- Stuck to sides of bulk bucket.
- Stuck to covering wrap during proofing
- Did not rise much during proof or bake


#### Day 0

1650: MEP/mix
1709: to proofer at 75F. Almost a batter, way looser than when using KAF bread flour.
1718: S+F
1730: S+F. still a loose mess, not a dough
1740: S+F
1756: S+F
1800: to fridge. a little over 1L in 4L bucket. way too loose to really S+F, form into a ball, or easily weigh.

#### Day 1

0805: Out, to 13x18x.75" pan. Filled the whole pan easily. Very flat. Very loose.
0845: oil, dimple. used herb oil. covered with another sheet pan since dough was sticking to bee wax paper
0915: dimple
1015: dimple. dough is chilly, slack, and not very tall
1130: oven on, 500F, "bake" without convection
1200: topped with rosemary
1220: lowered oven to 420F "convection bake", focaccia in. seems not very risen.
1232: rotate
1248: out

#### Next Time (Focaccia)

- Use bread flour - strength for rise. This is likely the main issue to address.
- Use steam. Other main issue.
- Use less olive oil on top to promote browning/rise.
- use 450F convection bake
- Use oven proofing mode for day 1 - let it rise a lot
- Use different pan: less wide/long, more tall
- maybe bottom rack


### 2025/02/24-26

> Focaccia!

#### Notes

- day 0: much less loose than previous focaccia dough. seems more likely to succeed.
- day 1: previous dough sank a little after bulk, this didn't. previous dough struggled to exit bulk bucket, this didn't.
- (Mostly) NAILED IT! Crispy crust, moist, chewy, flavorful crumb. Could use more salt/herbs/oil but otherwise perfect. Plenty tall.
  Less great once cooled but still great.

#### Day 0

1830: MEP/mix
1850: 1311g dough, to proofer @ 75F
1900: S+F
1910: S+F
1920: S+F
1930: S+F
1935: to fridge

#### Day 1

- 0740: USA Pan 13"x9" rectangular cake pan to proofer @ 75F
- 0810: dough to proofer, oiled and dimpled
- 0840: oiled, dimpled
- 0920: dimple, no oil
- 1020: dimple, no oil
- 1120: light dimpling, 1Tbsp oil
- 1130: oven on. "moisture plus" mode, 450F (❗️420F next time❗️)
- 1205: top. adjust oven to 475F (❗️don't do this next time❗️)
- 1208: to oven, second lowest rack. inject steam.
- 1212: oven to 450F (❗️420F next time❗️). steam finished.
- 1228: out. internal temp 207F

#### Next Time

- big flake sea salt topper
- more oil on top
- less oil on bottom
- much more rosemary/herbs
- lower temperatures for convection (and more tender crust once cooled)
- dimple ONCE, before baking. handle gently for big open crumb

### 2025/03/03


#### Day 0

1830: MEP/mix
mass 1316g
1855: to proofer @75F
1907: S+F
1917: S+F
1929: S+F
1940: S+F, to fridge

#### Day 1

- 0745: USA Pan 13"x9" rectangular cake pan to proofer @ 75F
- 0755: dough to proofer, oiled and dimpled
- 1125: oven on. 420F convection bake + steam. oiled, dimpled, topped with fresh rosemary and thyme. turned off proofer.
- 1155: to oven, steam
- 1205: rotate
- 1215: out. internal temp ranges 190F-207F

#### Notes

- delicious
- not enough salt on top
- thinner crust, still crispy
- moist crumb, but not very open
- too dense/underdone in the middle

#### Next Time

- figure out how to get more open crumb
  1. scale recipe down to 500g flour
  2. bake 450F no convection yes steam. consider: convection after rotation for crispier crust.
  3. S+F/bulk in a bowl, not a bucket
  4. preheat oven 1 full hour
  5. shorter proof: 2 hour max
  6. next next time: shorter bulk (1 night)
- flake salt topper
- parchment handles: Using the parchment tabs as handles, lift the focaccia out of the pan


### 2025/03/10


#### Day 0

1820: MEP/mix. BRM Artisan Bread Flour
1838: 927g to proofer in an oiled BOWL (large shiny)
1850: S+F
1900: S+F
1910: S+F
1920: S+F, to fridge in BOWL, tightly covered with plastic wrap


#### Day 1

0835: to proofer, in USA Pan Cake Pan, with parchment tab (one-side only), 2 Tbsp herb oil beneath, 1Tbsp herb oil above, lightly mushed to spread. does not cover pan.
1100: oven on, 475F convection bake plus steam (steam implies convection)

1147: change to bake @ 450F
1156: rotate

1207: out, 207F internal temp

#### Notes

- delicious
- small
- plenty of salt on top
- thin, crispy crust
- moist crumb, still not very open. maybe a little more that previously, but still not what I am going for.

#### Next Time

- scale recipe back up just a little. 523g flour.
- scale hydration up to 88% OR use KAF instead of BRM
- 4 hour second proof
- dimple just before oven, no sooner
