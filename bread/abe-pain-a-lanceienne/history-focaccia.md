## History

### 2025/02/17-19

> Focaccia!

#### Notes

- üö® Used KAF Italian-Style flour (but not the focaccia recipe on the back of the bag!)
    - This was likely a mistake! At least, not without adding extra flour.
- Stuck to sides of bulk bucket.
- Stuck to covering wrap during proofing
- Did not rise much during proof or bake


#### Day 0

1650: MEP/mix
1709: to proofer at 75F. Almost a batter, way looser than when using KAF bread flour.
1718: S+F
1730: S+F. still a loose mess, not a dough
1740: S+F
1756: S+F
1800: to fridge. a little over 1L in 4L bucket. way too loose to really S+F, form into a ball, or easily weigh.

#### Day 1

0805: Out, to 13x18x.75" pan. Filled the whole pan easily. Very flat. Very loose.
0845: oil, dimple. used herb oil. covered with another sheet pan since dough was sticking to bee wax paper
0915: dimple
1015: dimple. dough is chilly, slack, and not very tall
1130: oven on, 500F, "bake" without convection
1200: topped with rosemary
1220: lowered oven to 420F "convection bake", focaccia in. seems not very risen.
1232: rotate
1248: out

#### Next Time (Focaccia)

- Use bread flour - strength for rise. This is likely the main issue to address.
- Use steam. Other main issue.
- Use less olive oil on top to promote browning/rise.
- use 450F convection bake
- Use oven proofing mode for day 1 - let it rise a lot
- Use different pan: less wide/long, more tall
- maybe bottom rack


### 2025/02/24-26

> Focaccia!

#### Notes

- day 0: much less loose than previous focaccia dough. seems more likely to succeed.
- day 1: previous dough sank a little after bulk, this didn't. previous dough struggled to exit bulk bucket, this didn't.
- (Mostly) NAILED IT! Crispy crust, moist, chewy, flavorful crumb. Could use more salt/herbs/oil but otherwise perfect. Plenty tall.
  Less great once cooled but still great.

#### Day 0

1830: MEP/mix
1850: 1311g dough, to proofer @ 75F
1900: S+F
1910: S+F
1920: S+F
1930: S+F
1935: to fridge

#### Day 1

- 0920: dimple, no oil
- 1020: dimple, no oil
- 1120: light dimpling, 1Tbsp oil
- 1130: oven on. "moisture plus" mode, 450F (‚ùóÔ∏è420F next time‚ùóÔ∏è)
- 1205: top. adjust oven to 475F (‚ùóÔ∏èdon't do this next time‚ùóÔ∏è)
- 1208: to oven, second lowest rack. inject steam.
- 1212: oven to 450F (‚ùóÔ∏è420F next time‚ùóÔ∏è). steam finished.

#### Next Time

- more oil on top
- less oil on bottom
- much more rosemary/herbs
- lower temperatures for convection (and more tender crust once cooled)
