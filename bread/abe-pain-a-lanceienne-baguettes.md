## Directions

### Day 0

3. Mix 1m, either hand or mixer. Dough should be coarse and sticky.
4. Let dough hydrate, 5m.
5. Add olive oil, if using.
6. Mix 1m on medium-low or with wet hands. Dough should smooth but will still be a mess.
7. Use scraper to transfer to lightly oiled bucket.
8. Cover
9. Record "room temperature", dough mass, dough temperature.
10. Proof at 75F, 10m
11. On lightly oiled surface, perform 4 stretch-and-folds, one in each cardinal direction.
12. Flip dough, tuck into a ball.
13. Proof at 75F, 10m
14. On lightly oiled surface, perform 4 stretch-and-folds, one in each cardinal direction.
15. Flip dough, tuck into a ball.
16. Proof at 75F, 10m
17. On lightly oiled surface, perform 4 stretch-and-folds, one in each cardinal direction.
18. Flip dough, tuck into a ball.
19. Proof at 75F, 10m
20. On lightly oiled surface, perform 4 stretch-and-folds, one in each cardinal direction.
21. Flip dough, tuck into a ball.
22. Tightly cover, refrigerate up to 4 days

### Day 1: Baking Day

> Estimated time: 90 minutes

1. Preheat oven, with stone, to **500F** (not max, "Surround" mode) with ðŸš¨ steam function enabled ðŸš¨.
2. Remove dough from fridge 1 hour before baking time. Let sit 1 hour.
3. Prepare peel **pick one**:
    - Line with parchment paper
    - *Generously* dust with rice flour
    - *Generously* dust with semolina flour (works great)
4. Avoid handling the dough. Do not degas!
5. Using a curved bowl scraper, transfer dough to a floured work surface.
6. Dust dough with flour, flour hands
7. Do not degas!
8. Gently coax the dough into a 8"x8" square. Do not degas!
9. Cut a slice about 1.5" wide. 
10. Roll it gently into the flour to coat the cut.
11. With floured tools/hands, gently transfer to peel, parallel to peel handle.
12. Straighten and gently elongate to 9-10".
13. Repeat, keeping about 1" of space between loaves, until peel is full. ðŸš¨ NO MORE THAN FOUR! ðŸš¨ No crowding. Leave extra dough uncut for a second batch.
14. Slide baguettes on to stone.
15. ðŸš¨ Inject steam ðŸš¨
16. Lower temperature to 475F.
16. Bake for 12-18 minutes, rotating if needed (how?). Crust should be a rich brown.
17. Cool on wire rack for at least 15 minutes.


## History

### 2025/01/27-29

#### Day 0

- 1500: MEP. Water @52F
- 1516: to proofer @75F. internal temp 61F
- 1526: S+F
- 1537: S+F
- 1548: S+F
- 1600: S+F. dough to fridge. dough mass: 1043g

#### Day 1 (2025/01/29)

- 1320: dough to proofer @75F
- 1410: dough to bench
- 1425: to oven @525
- 1427: burst of steam
- 1432: space them out and cut the stuck ones apart
- 1439: out after 14m
- 1443: second batch in @500F, burst of steam
- 1457: done


Notes:
- too cramped, no more than 4 per batch
- forget the fancy magic peel, semolina plus regular peel works fine
- scale recipe up 25%. 567g flour is 1.5 batches at most.
- seems a little too moist, and uneven/over-browning. to bake longer, would need lower temp, so set to 500F, not 525F
- used non-convection mode. try convection for an even browning
- first batch had amazing holes, great flavor, wonderful chewey crumb, crispy crust when warm, almost too-moist inside, maybe too salty, and when cooled, maybe too-leathery crust.
- second batch was not as open but no less delicious or chewy. softer crust when cooled, lending credence to the idea of cooking at lower temp (second batch was cooked closer to 500F, first closer to 525F)
