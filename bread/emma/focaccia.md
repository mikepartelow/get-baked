> Source: https://www.emmafontanella.com/no-knead-focaccia

## Ingredients

- 560g bread flour or Italian 00 flour, with 12% protein content
- 470g water @40C ("lukewarm")
- 13g olive oil
- 11g kosher salt
- 7g instant yeast

### Notes on flour

[Bob's Red Mill Artisan Bread Flour = 12.5-13.5% Protein](https://support.bobsredmill.com/hc/en-us/articles/26292220612115-What-is-the-protein-content-of-your-flour).

Emma's recipe is formulated for 12% protein soft Italian wheat flour milled to 00 size. Using hard American wheat with a higher protein content requires adding more water.

## Directions

### Day 0: 2.5 hours

> ❗️ "if your dough is dry, don’t be afraid to add more water."
> ❗️❗️ Actually cover
> ❗️❗️❗️ No need for proofer

1. In a large bowl (❗️ medium shiny is too small ❗️) combine the water, salt, olive oil and yeast. Whisk.
2. Add flour and mix with spatula until dough is uniform and hydrated. 
3.❗️ Adjust water if needed!
4. Scrape down the sides and cover the bowl for 30 minutes.
5. Stretch and fold
6. Cover bowl, let sit 30 minutes.
7. Stretch and fold
8. Cover bowl, let sit 30 minutes.
9. Stretch and fold
10. Cover bowl, let sit 30 minutes.
11. Stretch and fold
12. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, put into fridge overnight.

> ❗️ "you should be able to cold-ferment this dough for up to 48 hours in the fridge, for even better flavor development. If you leave it longer than that, you risk it over proofing, which means the dough won’t rise in the oven and support big bubbles as it bakes."

> ‼️ To bake same day, skip the fridge and allow 30-40 more minutes of bulk fermentation.

### Day 1: 2.5 hours

> ❗️❗️ Actually cover, don't just put in proofer

0. Preheat proofer and pan
1. 🚨 Add a strip of parchment paper to the pan to create handles for lifting the bread out later.
2. Add 3-4 Tbsp olive oil to pan. Don't be stingy. Seriously!
3. Stretch and fold
4. Place dough into pan
5. Drizzle with olive oil
6. Dough to pan
7. Pan to proofer
8. Prepare to preheat oven
9. Proof for 2 hours (only 1 if skipping fridge)
10. Preheat oven to "Convection Bake", 420F (no steam!)
11. Drizzle with olive oil
12. Oil hands, dimple dough
13. Jiggle dough while dimpling to spread out in the pan
14. Add toppings
15. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turning once, on lower rack


## History

### 2025/03/23

#### Day 0

- used KAF bread flour, 12.7% protein
- 🚨 added 50g extra water (likely too much, oops)

- 0750: MEP
- 0815: to proofer, covered with plastic wrap, @75F
- 0845: S+F TURNED PROOFER OFF - very active, don't need proofer
- 0920: S+F. very active!
- 0950: S+F. now, not seeming over-wet. still very sticky but good texture and plenty of air.
- 1020: S+F, to fridge
- 🚨 1715: replaced plastic wrap with another mixing bowl because the dough had risen to touch the wrap

#### Day 1

> warm day, skipping proofer
> after 2:45 still seemed underproofed - did not hold dimples or fill pan
- massive oven spring
- did not brown too well, though plenty crispy
- unsurprisingly delicious, but holes aren't substantially better than previous recipe

- 1045: S+F
- 1050: to USA pan bake pan
- 1150: oven to 400F "convection bake"
- 1340: to oven. unconvinced it was proofed enough for huge holes but already did 2:45 of proofing. dimples were not deep.
- 1406: out after 27m. one turn. 209F internal temp.

#### Next Time

- don't adjust water, try recipe as formulated
- 3+ hour proof? proof until permanent dimples
- 420F+ oven temp, not 400 


## 2025/04/07-09

> KAF bread flour
> No proofer

### Day 0 (2025/04/07)

1115: MEP/mix
1130: cover
1205: S+F
1230: S+F
1300: S+F
1340: S+F, to fridge

### Day 1 (2025/04/09)

> even after 3h, not very bubbly or spread out. seemed proofed enough.
> massive oven spring again, but not even, not bubbly looking

0800: S+F, to hot-water-warmed pan, 3Tbsp oil on bottom, 1tsp oil on top, plastic wrap, couche on top
1020: oven on to 420F convection bake
1100: dimple, top
1105: to oven
1130: out, 205F internal, total bake time 25m

### Review:
- crust: not crispy enough
- crumb: moist, delicious, big holes
- shape: non-uniform (thinner around edges), fairly bubbly looking esp once cooled

### Next time:
> Goals:
>  crispier crunchier bottom crust
>   could eventually try cooking atop pizza steel (still in cake pan)
>  bigger, more uniform holes
>  uniform size
>  no dense spots

- stick to recipe
- 3+ hour rest at room temp
- 48hr in fridge is fine, no diff from 24h
- build tension in dough at all opportunities
- spread out at beginning and end, jiggle to spread, don't allow clumps inside
- continue with KAF bread flour
- 🚨 preheat oven to 500F for 1 hour, then drop temp to 420F
- bake longer if needed for crispier crust, at 84% hydration that should be fine
- aggressive dimpling, jiggle while dimpling
- brush with olive oil once done
