### Notes on flour

[Bob's Red Mill Artisan Bread Flour = 12.5-13.5% Protein](https://support.bobsredmill.com/hc/en-us/articles/26292220612115-What-is-the-protein-content-of-your-flour).

Emma's recipe is formulated for 12% protein soft Italian wheat flour milled to 00 size. Using hard American wheat with a higher protein content requires adding more water.

## Directions

### Day 0: 2.5 hours

> ❗️ "if your dough is dry, don’t be afraid to add more water."
> ❗️❗️ Actually cover
> ❗️❗️❗️ No need for proofer

1. In a large bowl (❗️ medium shiny is too small ❗️) combine the water, salt, olive oil and yeast. Whisk.
2. Add flour and mix with spatula until dough is uniform and hydrated. 
3.❗️ Adjust water if needed!
4. Scrape down the sides and cover the bowl for 30 minutes.

9. Stretch and fold
10. Cover bowl, let sit 30 minutes.
11. Stretch and fold
12. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, put into fridge overnight. 🚨 For big bubbles, bulk in a mixing bowl (not a cambro) so you don't pop bubbles getting the dough out 🚨

> ❗️ "you should be able to cold-ferment this dough for up to 48 hours in the fridge, for even better flavor development. If you leave it longer than that, you risk it over proofing, which means the dough won’t rise in the oven and support big bubbles as it bakes."

> ‼️ To bake same day, skip the fridge and allow 30-40 more minutes of bulk fermentation.

### Day 1: 3.5 hours

> ❗️❗️ Actually cover, don't just put in proofer

1. Preheat proofer and pan

6. Dough to pan
7. Prepare to preheat oven with steel
8. Proof for 2 hours (only 1 if skipping fridge)
9. Preheat oven to "Convection Bake", 420F (no steam!), with steel on lowest rack and middle rack set up
10. Drizzle with olive oil
11. Oil hands, dimple dough 🚨 without popping bubbles 🚨
12. Jiggle dough while dimpling to spread out in the pan

15. Brush/drizzle with olive oil (optional)
