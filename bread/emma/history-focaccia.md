# Emma Fontanella's No-Knead Focaccia


## History

### 2025/03/23

#### Day 0

- used KAF bread flour, 12.7% protein
- ðŸš¨ added 50g extra water (likely too much, oops)

- 0750: MEP
- 0815: to proofer, covered with plastic wrap, @75F
- 0845: S+F TURNED PROOFER OFF - very active, don't need proofer
- 0920: S+F. very active!
- 0950: S+F. now, not seeming over-wet. still very sticky but good texture and plenty of air.
- 1020: S+F, to fridge
- ðŸš¨ 1715: replaced plastic wrap with another mixing bowl because the dough had risen to touch the wrap

#### Day 1

> warm day, skipping proofer
> after 2:45 still seemed underproofed - did not hold dimples or fill pan
- massive oven spring
- did not brown too well, though plenty crispy
- unsurprisingly delicious, but holes aren't substantially better than previous recipe

- 1045: S+F
- 1050: to USA pan bake pan
- 1150: oven to 400F "convection bake"
- 1340: to oven. unconvinced it was proofed enough for huge holes but already did 2:45 of proofing. dimples were not deep.
- 1406: out after 27m. one turn. 209F internal temp.

#### Next Time

- don't adjust water, try recipe as formulated
- 3+ hour proof? proof until permanent dimples
- 420F+ oven temp, not 400 


## 2025/04/07-09

> KAF bread flour
> No proofer

### Day 0 (2025/04/07)

1115: MEP/mix
1130: cover
1205: S+F
1230: S+F
1300: S+F
1340: S+F, to fridge

### Day 1 (2025/04/09)

> even after 3h, not very bubbly or spread out. seemed proofed enough.
> massive oven spring again, but not even, not bubbly looking

0800: S+F, to hot-water-warmed pan, 3Tbsp oil on bottom, 1tsp oil on top, plastic wrap, couche on top
1020: oven on to 420F convection bake
1100: dimple, top
1105: to oven
1130: out, 205F internal, total bake time 25m

### Review:
- crust: not crispy enough
- crumb: moist, delicious, big holes
- shape: non-uniform (thinner around edges), fairly bubbly looking esp once cooled

### Next time:
> Goals:
>  crispier crunchier bottom crust
>   could eventually try cooking atop pizza steel (still in cake pan)
>  bigger, more uniform holes
>  uniform size
>  no dense spots

- stick to recipe
- 3+ hour rest at room temp
- 48hr in fridge is fine, no diff from 24h
- build tension in dough at all opportunities
- spread out at beginning and end, jiggle to spread, don't allow clumps inside
- continue with KAF bread flour
- ðŸš¨ preheat oven to 500F for 1 hour, then drop temp to 420F
- bake longer if needed for crispier crust, at 84% hydration that should be fine
- aggressive dimpling, jiggle while dimpling
- brush with olive oil once done

## 2025/05/04-05 (one overnight)

### Day 0

- 1540: MEP/mix
- 1550: rest 30m
- 1620: S+F
- 1655: S+F
- 1725: S+F, to fridge in 6L cambro

### Day 1

> Used 9x13" dark (rachael ray) pan
> Used 4 Tbsp oil
> Tried to create tension after final S+F

- 1035: oiled pan with 4 Tbsp oil, S+F, stretched a little into pan
- 1145: oven to 420F convection bake, with steel on bottom shelf
- 1245: dimple, jiggle, stretch, top with canned black olives, oil and zatar
- 1250: bread in
- bread out after 23m

#### Notes

- tons of oven spring as usual
- oven spring cancels out dimples
- perfectly crispy bottom crust
- denser than previous crumb - no giant holes
- not salty enough on the topping
- perfectly good, would eat again. could be crisper on bottom, could have bigger holes, could be a bit moister


#### Next Time

- 3 hour proof <-- forreal
- 48hr in fridge is no diff from 24h
- build tension in dough at all opportunities
- ðŸš¨ bake at 450F
- ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ bulk in mixing bowl
- aggressive dimpling, jiggle while dimpling
- brush with olive oil once done
