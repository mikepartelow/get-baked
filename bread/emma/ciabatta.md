> Source: https://www.emmafontanella.com/easy-no-knead-ciabatta-bread

## Ingredients

- 450g strong bread flour or Italian 00 flour, with 13% protein content
- 400g water @40C ("lukewarm")
- 9g kosher salt
- 7g instant yeast

### Notes on flour

[Bob's Red Mill Artisan Bread Flour = 12.5-13.5% Protein](https://support.bobsredmill.com/hc/en-us/articles/26292220612115-What-is-the-protein-content-of-your-flour).

Emma's recipe is formulated for 13% protein strong Italian wheat flour milled to 00 size. 

> "I use a high protein Italian Type 00 flour called “Garofalo W 350 Type 00”. The reason is that this particular flour has a particularly high quality gluten content that will stand up to long fermentations (up to 48 hours). It also absorbs water well."
