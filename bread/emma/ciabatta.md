# Emma Fontanella's No-Knead Ciabatta

> Source: https://www.emmafontanella.com/easy-no-knead-ciabatta-bread

## Ingredients

- 450g strong bread flour or Italian 00 flour, with 13% protein content
- 400g water @40C ("lukewarm")
- 9g kosher salt
- 7g instant yeast

### Notes on flour

[Bob's Red Mill Artisan Bread Flour = 12.5-13.5% Protein](https://support.bobsredmill.com/hc/en-us/articles/26292220612115-What-is-the-protein-content-of-your-flour).

Emma's recipe is formulated for 13% protein strong Italian wheat flour milled to 00 size. 

> "I use a high protein Italian Type 00 flour called “Garofalo W 350 Type 00”. The reason is that this particular flour has a particularly high quality gluten content that will stand up to long fermentations (up to 48 hours). It also absorbs water well."

## Directions

### Day 0: 2.5 hours

1. (In a square mixing bowl) Mix water, salt and yeast. 
2. Add flour, mix well with a fork to form a very wet, loose, shaggy dough. 
3. Cover bowl, let hydrate for 30 minutes.
4. Stretch and fold.
5. Cover bowl, let sit 30 minutes.
6. Stretch and fold.
7. Cover bowl, let sit 30 minutes.
8. Stretch and fold.
9. Cover bowl, let sit 30 minutes.
10. Stretch and fold.
11. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, put into fridge overnight.

### Day 1: 2 hours

> Dough should be very bubbly in the fridge

0. Remove dough from fridge.
1. Stone or steel to oven (try both! take notes!)
2. Preheat oven to 450F, convection + steam
3. Generously dust work surface with flour. Use a sifter to ensure no gaps in flour coverage.
4. Generously dust couche with flour. Rice flour works well. 
5. Upend bowl to eject dough on to work surface.
6. Wet hands.
7. Quickly and with a light touch, tidy up the dough into a square
8. Gently and quickly fold in half to form a rectangle
9. Tuck edges
10. Cut dough into four loaves
11. Transfer loaves to couche (see video)
12. Gently stretch loaves
13. Dust loaves with flour
14. Fold couche to cover loaves
15. Proof for at least 20 minute (seems short?!)
16. Set parchment paper on peel. 🚨 We are baking two batches 🚨
17. Dough is upside down on couche - so use couche to flip dough onto a bench scraper
18. Slide dough from scraper on to parchment paper
19. Launch ciabattas on to stone/steel
20. 🚨 Steam! 🚨
21. Bake 15-20 minutes, until deep golden brown
22. Record internal temp, etc.
23. Bake the other two loaves.


## History

### 2025/04/12-14

#### Day 0

> KAF bread flour
> bulk in largest mixing bowl

1820: MEP/mix
1835: hydrate 30m
1905: S+F
1940: S+F
2005: S+F
2045: S+F, to fridge

#### Day 1

> Using pizza steel on rack 3 (middle)

1045: oven on, 450F convection + steam. pizza steel.
1045: dough out
1140: shape
1150: proof 20m
1210: first 2 in, burst of steam
1230: out
1235: the rest

#### Notes

- first 2 loaves were smaller and more torpedo-shaped than expected from videos/pics (but not from recipe), second got stretched better
- "creamy" inside or slightly undercooked?
- this recipe uses a ton of yeast. less-yeast ciabattas might have better flavor but this one has effortless bubbles
- incredible oven spring on first batch, less incredible on second batch which i stretched a lot
- internal temp 211F on second batch, but still "kind of gooey" inside
- thick crust when cooled, maybe too thick: hotter oven should fix

#### Next time

- hotter oven - try 475F
- scale recipe up
- shape better
