## 🚨 Important!

- Measure water before heating it up.
- Note dough temps throughout.

- 🚨 Proofer Box the sponge.
- 🚨🚨 Remember to preheat the oven!
- 🚨🚨🚨 Ignore timings - pay attention to the dough. 
- 🚨🚨🚨🚨 Before going into oven, dough should clear the tops of the loaf pans.
- 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 Use steam injection
- 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 Poke test!

## Equipment
- Small mixing bowl (for soaker)
- Plastic wrap, towels
- Largest mixing bowl
- Large bowl or dough bucket for fermenting
- Proofer box
- Water heater
- Thermometer
- Spatula
- Dough knife

## Directions

### Day 0: Soaker Day

1. Remove butter from fridge. Mise en place for next morning.
2. Mix cornmeal and 227g of water in a small bowl. Cover. Let sit overnight at room temperature.

### Day 1: Baking Day

1. Turn on Proofer Box, set to 80-85F.
2. Prepare Sponge.
    1. In large mixing bowl, mix 243g of flour with yeast, Soaker, and water @ 38C.
    2. Place Sponge in Proofer Box.
    3. Ferment Sponge for 60m or until it bubbles, whichever is longer.
3. Add remaining flour, salt, molasses, and butter.
4. Stir or mix in mixer until ingredients form a ball.
5. Knead dough on floured surface, or in mixer at medium, about 8-10 minutes in the mixer (setting 2 of 4) or 10 minutes by hand.
6. Add more flour if dough is sticky.
7. When dough absolutely aces (not just "passes") Windowpane Test, stop kneading.
8. Lightly oil a bowl or dough bucket and add the dough.
9. Note dough temperature and weight. **Desired Dough Temperature:** 77-81F.
10. Ferment in Proofer Box until the dough doubles in size (likely at least 90m).
11. On a floured surface, degass the dough.
12. Divide dough into 2 or 3 pieces. 3 loaves if using USA Pan Smalls, 2 loaves if using Larges.
13. Form into loaves. See BBA page 82 or Artisan Breads Every Day page 23.
14. Add to loaf pans. 🚨 Dough should touch all edges of pan, not shrink in the middle. 🚨
15. Note dough temperature.
16. 🚨 Preheat oven to 375F (BBA says 350) 🚨 Set for steam injection 🚨
17. Proof loaves in Proofer Box at 80-85F for at least 60-90m. 
18. Remove loaves from proofer when dough clears the tops of the loaf pans. Not before!
19. 🚨 Perform the poke test 🚨
20. Mist loaves with water, sprinkle cornmeal on top.
    - Don't under-mist. The mist enables oven spring.
21. Bake loaves in oven for 20m. 🚨 Use steam injection 🚨 (and record its use)
22. Rotate loaves. Bake another 20-30m, until well browned and internal temperature is at least 185F.
23. Remove loaves from oven. Note temperature. Remove loaves from pans and rest on resting rack for 1h.

## Things to try

- [ ] longer primary fermentation, less longer proof
- [ ] we expect 1" over the pan edge, not "just barely"
- [ ] maximize oven spring: how?
    - [ ] perform a poke test: Gently press your fingertip into the dough. If it springs back quickly, it’s underproofed. If it doesn’t spring back at all, it’s overproofed. Ideally, it should spring back slowly.
    - [ ] knead longer: 10m is OK
    - [ ] inject steam when adding bread, not before
    - [ ] use 9x5 not 10x5 pans
    - [ ] full 8m of kneading
    - [ ] bake 375F


## History

### 2025/01/03-04

- ❗️ Added 80g flour during mixing to reduce stickiness.
- Used different amounts of soaker/dough flour than recipe (same total).

Day 1:
- 0850: Prepare sponge (using 336g flour)
- 0905: Sponge resting
- 1020: Mix dough
- 1024: Dough to mixer (dough hook) on medium (setting #2)
- 1026: Add 80g flour to reduce stickiness
- 1030: Manual kneading to test and pass windowpane
- 1035: To Proofer Box @ 80F. Initial dough temp: 71F. (🚨 should have massed the dough at this point!)
- 1205: Fermentation done. Dough mass: 1428.5g. Divided and shaped into three loaves.
- 1215: To Proofer Box @ 85F. Internal dough temp: 73F. (🚨 due to user error, proofer was unpowered for 45m!)
- 1344: Remove from proofer. Spray, dust with cornmeal, place loaf pans on a baking sheet.
- 1346: Baking sheet with loaf pans to oven @ 350F.
- 1410: Rotate loaves.
- 1430: Loaves out, on to resting racks.

Total Time: 5h40m (5h30m estimated)
Yield: 1428g/1356g = 105%
Review: Although the loaves are small, the bread is delicious, the crumb is not overly dense, the crust is crackly.

### 2025/01/08-09

Day 1:
    0720: Prepare sponge (243g flour)
    0730: Sponge to proofer @76F
    0846: mix: quick hand mix, then to mixer with dough hook on speed 1
    0846: knead in mixer on setting 2, 6m +1m30s
    0902: passed windowpane test, added only a little flour. internal temp 75F
    0905: to proofer @80F, misted top
    1037: dough has doubled, divided 1366g dough into TWO loaves into two 10x5x3" pans
    1044: dough to proofer @80f, misted tops. Internal dough temp 75F.
    1215: preheat oven to 350F, steam injection enabled (manual mode)
    1240: activated manual steam burst, which adds steam to oven on demand and deactivates after 8-10m
    1251: loaves barely cleared top of pans, misted, dusted, to (steamy) oven
    1300: very little oven spring
    1311: rotate
    1333: out. internal temp 206F

Total Time: 6h13m
Yield: 1336g/1356g = 98.5%
Review: fluffier texture and better flavor than previous (which had an off-aftertaste). Crust is soft and separated from crumb.
Next time: 
- Knead longer to more authoritatively pass Windowpane. 
- Degass after fermentation. 
- Spread dough to cover pan.
- Poke test proofing. 
- Inject steam when adding loaf, not before. 
- Bake at 375F, not 350F.
