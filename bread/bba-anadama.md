## Directions

### Day 0: Soaker Day

1. Mix cornmeal and 227g of water in a small bowl. Cover. Let sit overnight at room temperature.

### Day 1: Baking Day

1. Turn on Proofer Box, set to 80-85F.
2. Prepare Sponge.
    1. In large mixing bowl, mix 243g of flour with yeast, Soaker, and water @ 38C.
    2. Place Sponge in Proofer Box.
    3. Ferment Sponge for 60m or until it bubbles, whichever is longer.
3. Add remaining flour, salt, molasses, and butter.
4. Stir or mix in mixer until ingredients form a ball.
5. Knead dough on floured surface, or in mixer at medium, about 6-8 minutes in the mixer or 10 minutes by hand.
6. Add more flour if dough is sticky.
7. When dough passes Windowpane Test, stop kneading.
8. Lightly oil a bowl or dough bucket and add the dough.
9. Note dough temperature and weight. Temperature should read 77-81F.
10. Ferment in Proofer Box until the dough doubles in size (likely at least 90m).
11. On a floured surface, divide dough into 2 or 3 pieces. 3 loaves if using USA Pan Smalls, 2 loaves if using Larges.
12. Form into loaves. 
13. Add to loaf pans.
14. Note dough temperature.
15. üö® Preheat oven to 350F üö®
16. Proof loaves in Proofer Box at 80-85F for at least 60-90m. 
17. Remove loaves from proofer when dough clears the tops of the loaf pans.
18. Mist loaves with water, sprinkle cornmeal on top.
19. Bake loaves in oven for 20m.
20. Rotate loaves. Bake another 20-30m, until well browned and internal temperature is at least 185F.
21. Remove loaves from oven. Note temperature. Remove loaves from pans and rest on resting rack for 1h.

## Things to try

- [ ] use proofer box for the sponge

## History

### 2025/01/03-04

- ‚ùóÔ∏è Added 80g flour during mixing to reduce stickiness.
- Used different amounts of soaker/dough flour than recipe (same total).

Day 1:
- 0850: Prepare sponge (using 336g flour)
- 0905: Sponge resting
- 1020: Mix dough
- 1024: Dough to mixer (dough hook) on medium (setting #2)
- 1026: Add 80g flour to reduce stickiness
- 1030: Manual kneading to test and pass windowpane
- 1035: To Proofer Box @ 80F. Initial dough temp: 71F. (üö® should have massed the dough at this point!)
- 1205: Fermentation done. Dough mass: 1428.5g. Divided and shaped into three loaves.
- 1215: To Proofer Box @ 85F. Internal dough temp: 73F. (üö® due to user error, proofer was unpowered for 45m!)
- 1344: Remove from proofer. Spray, dust with cornmeal, place loaf pans on a baking sheet.
- 1346: Baking sheet with loaf pans to oven.
- 1410: Rotate loaves.
- 1430: Loaves out, on to resting racks.

Total Time: 5h40m (5h30m estimated)
Yield: 1428g/1356g = 105%
