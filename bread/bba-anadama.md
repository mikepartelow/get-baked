## 🚨 Important!

- Measure water before heating it up.
- Note dough temps throughout.
- Use extra flour until dough is not sticky.
- Mass the final dough.
- 🚨 Proofer Box the sponge.
- 🚨🚨 Remember to preheat the oven!
- 🚨🚨🚨 Ignore timings - pay attention to the dough. 
- 🚨🚨🚨🚨 Before going into oven, dough should **confidently** clear the tops of the loaf pans.
- 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 Use steam injection
- 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 Poke test!
- 🚨🚨 Note initial dough volume so you can tell when it has bulked! 🚨🚨
- 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 Shape with tension! 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

## Equipment
- Small mixing bowl (for soaker)
- Plastic wrap, towels
- Largest mixing bowl
- Large bowl or dough bucket for fermenting
- Proofer box
- Water heater
- Thermometer
- Spatula
- Dough knife
- Silpat
- Extra flour
- Oil for fermenting
- Measuring cups
- 2x 1.5lb loaf pans, or 3x 1lb loaf pans
- Baking sheet
- Water mister
- Resting racks

## Directions

### Day 0: Soaker Day

1. Remove butter from fridge. Mise en place for next morning.
2. Mix polenta and water in a small bowl. Cover. Let sit overnight at room temperature.

### Day 1: Baking Day

1. Turn on Proofer Box, set to 77F.
2. Prepare Sponge.
    1. In large mixing bowl, mix sponge flour with yeast, Soaker, and water @ 38C.
    2. Place Sponge in Proofer Box.
    3. Ferment Sponge for 60m or until it bubbles.
3. Add remaining flour, salt, molasses, and butter.
4. Stir or mix in mixer until ingredients form a ball.
5. Knead dough on floured surface, or in mixer at medium, about 8-10 minutes in the mixer (setting 2 of 4) or 10 minutes by hand.
6. Add more flour if dough is sticky.
7. When dough absolutely aces (not just "passes") Windowpane Test, stop kneading. 
8. Lightly oil a bowl or dough bucket and add the dough.
9. Note dough temperature and weight. **Desired Dough Temperature:** 77-81F.
10. Ferment in Proofer Box until the dough gets to 150% original size (60ish min). 🚨🚨 Note initial dough volume 🚨🚨
11. On an **unfloured** surface, gently degass the dough.
12. Divide dough into 2 or 3 pieces. 3 loaves if using USA Pan Smalls, 2 loaves if using Larges.
13. Form into loaves. See BBA page 82 or Artisan Breads Every Day page 23. 🚨🚨 Create/maintain tension in the dough. 🚨🚨
14. Add to loaf pans. 🚨 Dough should touch all edges of pan, not shrink in the middle. 🚨
15. Note dough temperature.
16. 🚨 Preheat oven to 375F (BBA says 350 but 375 gives better crust) 🚨 Set for steam injection 🚨
17. Proof loaves in Proofer Box at 77F for at least 60-90m. 
18. Remove loaves from proofer when dough clears the tops of the loaf pans. Not before!
19. 🚨 Perform the poke test 🚨
20. Mist loaves with water, sprinkle cornmeal or polenta on top.
    - Don't under-mist. The mist encourages oven spring.
21. Bake loaves in oven for 20m. 🚨 Use steam injection 🚨 (and record its use)
22. Rotate loaves. Bake another 20-30m, until well browned and internal temperature is at least 185F.
23. Remove loaves from oven. Note temperature. Remove loaves from pans and rest on resting rack for 1h.

## History

### 2025/01/03-04

- ❗️ Added 80g flour during mixing to reduce stickiness.
- Used different amounts of soaker/dough flour than recipe (same total).

Day 1:
- 0850: Prepare sponge (using 336g flour)
- 0905: Sponge resting
- 1020: Mix dough
- 1024: Dough to mixer (dough hook) on medium (setting #2)
- 1026: Add 80g flour to reduce stickiness
- 1030: Manual kneading to test and pass windowpane
- 1035: To Proofer Box @ 80F. Initial dough temp: 71F. (🚨 should have massed the dough at this point!)
- 1205: Fermentation done. Dough mass: 1428.5g. Divided and shaped into three loaves.
- 1215: To Proofer Box @ 85F. Internal dough temp: 73F. (🚨 due to user error, proofer was unpowered for 45m!)
- 1344: Remove from proofer. Spray, dust with cornmeal, place loaf pans on a baking sheet.
- 1346: Baking sheet with loaf pans to oven @ 350F.
- 1410: Rotate loaves.
- 1430: Loaves out, on to resting racks.

Total Time: 5h40m (5h30m estimated)
Yield: 1428g/1356g = 105%
Review: Although the loaves are small, the bread is delicious, the crumb is not overly dense, the crust is crackly.

### 2025/01/08-09

Day 1:
    0720: Prepare sponge (243g flour)
    0730: Sponge to proofer @76F
    0846: mix: quick hand mix, then to mixer with dough hook on speed 1
    0846: knead in mixer on setting 2, 6m +1m30s
    0902: passed windowpane test, added only a little flour. internal temp 75F
    0905: to proofer @80F, misted top
    1037: dough has doubled, divided 1366g dough into TWO loaves into two 10x5x3" pans
    1044: dough to proofer @80f, misted tops. Internal dough temp 75F.
    1215: preheat oven to 350F, steam injection enabled (manual mode)
    1240: activated manual steam burst, which adds steam to oven on demand and deactivates after 8-10m
    1251: loaves barely cleared top of pans, misted, dusted, to (steamy) oven
    1300: very little oven spring
    1311: rotate
    1333: out. internal temp 206F

Total Time: 6h13m
    - Knead: 7m30s
    - Bulk: 1h32m
    - Proof: 2h5m
    - Bake: 42m
Yield: 1336g/1356g = 98.5%
Review: fluffier texture and better flavor than previous (which had an off-aftertaste). Crust is soft and separated from crumb.
Next time: 
- Knead longer to more authoritatively pass Windowpane. 
- Degass after fermentation. 
- Spread dough to cover pan.
- Poke test proofing. 
- Inject steam when adding loaf, not before. 
- Bake at 375F, not 350F.

### 2025/01/11-12

Day 1:
- 0815: MEP, prepare sponge. Using SAF-Instant "Premium"
- 0825: Sponge to proofer @80F
- 0925: Mix.
- 0935: knead in bosch compact bread mixer, setting 2, targeting 8m
- 0943: to bench. adjusting flour. windowpane test. fail
- 0947: stretch and fold. 3m rest.
- 0950: stretch and fold. 5m rest.
- 0957: stretch and fold. 3m rest.
- 1000: stretch and fold. windowpane passes.
- 1004: 73F dough internal temp, 1365g dough mass. to proof box @ 80F. also placed loaf pans in proofer.
- 1127: degass, divide dough in half.
- 1136: shaped, large loaf pans, to proofer @80F
- 1302: poke test suggests good/slightly-over proof. misted, dusted, to oven @ 375F. "manual" steam on introduction.
- 1306: steam completed.
- 1323: turn loaves
- 1343: out. internal temp 208. darker than previous loaves (used higher oven temp)

Notes:
- 375F gives better crust than 350
- Unlike last batch, crust did not separate. Intended fix for crust separation was longer gluten development (knead). So presumably that worked, keeping recommendation to knead on #2 for 8+ instead of 6+.
- I am disappointed by the oven spring on this recipe. However, most internet people (with one exception) don't get much oven spring from Anadama bread. And I have no complaints on flavor or texture. It could just be destined to be a stubby loaf.
- Figure out how to get better oven spring.
    - use polenta? internet commentor says this is key.
    - Bulk ferment to 130% of original size, not 200%
    - cooler ferment temps
    - Better loaf shaping, esp. tension!

> I've made a few more loaves of anadama bread, and I think the key is to use coarse cornmeal, which is often labled in the grocery store as polenta. I've found that I have to cook it a bit with boiling water before baking, otherwise it's pretty darned crunchy and unappetizing. But, well made, it's fairly light. I think the smaller the grains, the more the corn interferes with good gluten development. Every time I use regular cornmeal, I get a brick.

### 2025/01/15-16

Day 1:

- 0730: Make sponge
- 0735: sponge to proofer @76
- 0835: mix, knead [ POWER OUTAGE! ] - hand
- 0900: 1440g dough to **unpowered** proofer. dough temp 70F.
- 1000: still no power! 
- 1010: misted loaves, covered, to **unpowered** fridge. dough feels much livelier and stronger than before (could be fooling myself).
- 1520: loaves to proofer @76F
- 1600: oven on to 375F
- 1646: loaves (still cold) to oven. Burst Of Steam. 
- 1701: adjust temp to 350F, open door a little to let out steam
- 1716: rotate loaves
- 1729: loaves out. internal temp 203F. 

Notes:

- Used **polenta** (Bob's Red Mill) instead of "cornmeal": keep using polenta 
- Used **brer rabbit mild** molasses instead of smart & final brand: noticeably better flavor!
- shaped on **unfloured** surface
- power outage!! put loaves in fridge by necessity.
- used too much oil in proofing bucket
- starting to suspect the problem is not "oven spring" but "not enough dough to make the loaf size I want"
    - try: scale up the recipe - 850g of flour
    - try: scale up the yeast (without scaling the flour)
- underproofed, too dense. but best flavor yet
