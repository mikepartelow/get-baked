## History

### 2025/07/26

> Used BRM unbleached white AP
> Used Green Land Food Zatar Moloki
> Used Greek Gods plain NONFAT
> proofed at room temp, 21C

- 1700: MEP/mix
- 1715: knead in bosch compact, speed 2, 9m. not at all passing windowpane, very loose dough.
- 1730: 754g after rolling in AP flour on silpat. divided into 3 x 250g, proofed room temp (21C) in pizza ball containers
- 1815: oven on. 525F surround, steel on #3 (middle), rack on #1 (bottom)
- 1922: pies in. one very thin peel pie, one 10" circle pan, one 9x13" pan.

#### Next Time

- use bread flour
- make an overnight dough, and use much less yeast
- instead of surround, use convection bake - heat from top will burn zatar, 525F on steel is too hot
- increase dough hydration
- ensure uniform oilness of zatar topping - this time, only the first pie topped had oily zatar, which prevented zatar burning
- consider more oil in the zatar topping
- don't overbake the steel-top one
- ok to use pans but split dough further, don't want thick zatar pie
- find a new recipe
