# History

2025/01/02: baked two pizzas: first 3 cheese (as listed above) directly on stone baked 10-11m, the second on perforated oven (not pizza) pan, topped with hawaiian toppings, baked 12-13m. both crusts were chewy with great bread flavor. second was doughy, not browned, on bottom. second's "crust" end was perfectly crispy, first's was more chewy.
