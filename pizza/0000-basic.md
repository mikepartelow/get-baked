# 0000 Basic Pizza

> The recipe for the second pizza I've made

## Ingredients

- Dough: [Alton's overnight](./doughs/altons-overnight.md)
- Sauce: [basic tomato](./sauces/basic-tomato.md)
- Cheese blend:
    - Mozzarella
    - Asiago
    - Caciocavallo (probably - have to check label at grocery next time!)

## Equipment

- [ ] pizza stone
- [ ] perforated pizza pan
- [ ] peel
- [ ] corn meal for dusting peel
- [ ] dough knife

## Directions

1. Make dough 18-24 hours prior to Pizza Time.
2. [Optional] Make sauce, refrigerate it. 
3. Preheat pizza stone on max ("Surround Mode") oven at least 30 minutes
4. If sauce isn't premade, make sauce.
5. Prepare dough and let it rest 30 minutes.
6. Stretch dough into pizzas, add sauce and toppings, bake 10-15 minutes, being careful not to dry out the crust.
    - Bake pizzas directly on stone or on a perforated pizza pan.
7. ðŸš¨ Wait at least 5m before slicing, and preferably another 5 after that before eating. ðŸš¨

# Things to try

- [ ] oilier dough!
- [ ] ðŸš¨ less cheese so we can taste the sauce
- [x] sweeter sauce
- [ ] proper perforated pizza pan for crispy crust (not the oven pan kind)
- [ ] cheese mix: 50% mozz, 20% cacviocavello, 20% fontina, 10% or less of asiago or parmesan
- [ ] trader joe's dry sun dried tomatoes between sauce and cheese
- [ ] pop bubbles while it cooks
- [ ] for thinner crust, maybe proof longer and definitely roll it out flatter 

# History

## 2025/01/02
- baked two pizzas: first 3 cheese (as listed above) directly on stone baked 10-11m, the second on perforated oven (not pizza) pan, topped with hawaiian toppings, baked 12-13m. both crusts were chewy with great bread flavor. second was doughy, not browned, on bottom. second's "crust" end was perfectly crispy, first's was more chewy.

## 2022/01/11

- 2 boules, alton's dough.
- used whole milk mozzarella, cacciocavallo, and fontina
- 2 pizzas. proofed dough 30m (first pizza). basic tomato sauce. 
- oven at 525, surround setting. stone preheated 30+
- first one out 11m, a little too dry in the crust on thinner bottomed pieces, but perfect on thicker bottomed pieces. next time, try for uniform bottom thickness.
- second out at 9m. Perfectly cooked. Dough is really doughy (too doughy? not exactly, super good) with huge bubbles and thick bottom. On part of the pizza, Trader Joe's dry sun dried tomatoes between sauce and cheese. REALLY GOOD.
- neighbor liked it. so did i. good pizza is easy to make. excellent pizza is hard.
