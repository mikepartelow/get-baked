## History

### 2025/01/02
Good! Took closer to 2 hours to reduce. Sicuan peppercorns not well distributed (recipe updated to recommend powderization). Needs more sweetness for balance.

## 2024/01/11
- used 1 Tbsp honey in place of 1 tsp sugar
- no sichuan peppercorns
- used both 1 tsp dried oregano and 1 Tbsp fresh
