## Things to try
- [ ] More sweetness
- [ ] No sicuan peppercorns
- [ ] Honey instead of sugar
- [ ] Brown sugar instead of white

## History

- 2025/01/02: Good! Took closer to 2 hours to reduce. Sicuan peppercorns not well distributed (recipe updated to recommend powderization). Needs more sweetness for balance.
