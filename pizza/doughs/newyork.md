## Directions

### Day 0: Dough Day

1. Place water in mixing bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, mix salt, yeast and sugar into flour
3. Combine flour/salt/yeast mixture into water and mix until all the flour has been incorporated.
4. After flour has been totally incorporated, add oil and knead for about 4 to 5 minutes
    1. If you want to use the dough the next day, knead a little more (slow speed for about 8 to 10 minutes).
    2. If you have time to let the dough rest for 3 days, knead for 4 to 5 minutes, low speed or hand knead.
5. Record final dough mass and temperature. Desired dough temperature: high 70s to low 80s F
6. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces, each should mass ~326 grams.
7. Shape into a ball, and place in greased, sealed quart-sized container or oiled/greased freezer bag.
8. Refrigerate overnight or up to 72 hours 
    1. [Recipe author](https://feelingfoodish.com/the-best-new-york-style-pizza-dough/) prefers 3 days

### Day 1: Bake Day

1. Remove dough balls within 1 hour of baking and allow the dough to come to room temperature. 
    1. [Recipe author](https://feelingfoodish.com/the-best-new-york-style-pizza-dough/) says: I often bake coldish dough without problems
2. Place pizza stone in oven. Preheat to 550F, at least 1 hour.
    1. [Recipe author](https://feelingfoodish.com/the-best-new-york-style-pizza-dough/) says:
        1. Do not place the stone near the bottom of your oven.
        2. Bake the pizza within 6 to 8 inches of the top of your oven, so that the tops browns sufficiently in conjunction with the bottom of the pizza.
        3. The heat from the stone will cook the pizza bottom and the broiler can brown the top.
        4. Use partly frozen cheese and cold sauce if the cheese browns too quickly.
3. Open each dough ball using care not to degas.
    1. Do NOT ever use a rolling pin!
    2. Take care not to “degas” the rim of your pizza as you are spreading your dough!
4. Transfer to a semolina- or cornmeal-dusted pizza peel (or on parchment paper).
5. Top with your favorite sauce, cheese, or other toppings.
    1. Not too much sauce or the pizza will be soggy.
6. Bake 4-6 minutes until cheese has melted but not burned and is browned on top.
