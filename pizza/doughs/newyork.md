- Dough knife
- Silpat
- Extra flour

## Directions

### Day 0: Dough Day : 30 minutes

1. Place water in mixing bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, mix salt, yeast and sugar into flour
3. Combine flour/salt/yeast mixture into water and mix until all the flour has been incorporated.
4. After flour has been totally incorporated, add oil and knead for about 8 to 10 minutes, until it aces windowpane test.
5. Record final dough mass and temperature. Desired dough temperature: high 70s to low 80s F
6. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces, each should mass ~326 grams.
7. Shape into a ball, and place in greased, sealed quart-sized container or oiled/greased freezer bag. 🚨 Really grease up the container. No sticking! 🚨
8. Refrigerate overnight or up to 72 hours 
    1. [Recipe author](https://feelingfoodish.com/the-best-new-york-style-pizza-dough/) prefers 3 days

### Day 1: Bake Day : 3 hours

1. Remove dough balls within 1 hour of baking and allow the dough to come to room temperature. 
    1. [Recipe author](https://feelingfoodish.com/the-best-new-york-style-pizza-dough/) says: I often bake coldish dough without problems
2. Place pizza stone in oven. Preheat to 500+F, at least 1 hour, on "surround" mode.
    1. [Recipe author](https://feelingfoodish.com/the-best-new-york-style-pizza-dough/) says:
        1. Do not place the stone near the bottom of your oven.
        2. Bake the pizza within 6 to 8 inches of the top of your oven, so that the tops browns sufficiently in conjunction with the bottom of the pizza.
        3. The heat from the stone will cook the pizza bottom and the broiler can brown the top.
        4. Use partly frozen cheese and cold sauce if the cheese browns too quickly.
3. Open each dough ball using care not to degas.
    1. Do NOT ever use a rolling pin!
    2. Take care not to “degas” the rim of your pizza as you are spreading your dough!
4. Transfer to a semolina- or cornmeal-dusted pizza peel (or on parchment paper).
5. Top with your favorite sauce, cheese, or other toppings.
    1. Not too much sauce or the pizza will be soggy.
6. Bake 4-6 minutes until cheese has melted but not burned and is browned on top.


## History

### 2025/01/17-18

#### Day 0

- 1710: MEP, mix, knead by hand until passing windowpane.
- 1740: to fridge. dough mass 1340g, @ 85F before divide/shape

#### Day 1
- 1700: dough out
- 1830: first pizza in

#### Things to try:
- [ ] smoother sauce

#### Notes
- I liked this dough better than Alton's.
- Used "basic tomato sauce". Too chunky.
- Dough dried out in fridge, because it was loosely covered. Although this affected shaping it had no apparent effect on flavor/texture.
- Dough was too cold upon shaping - need longer and/or temp-controlled rest after fridge
- Of the four pizzas, each crust was better than the previous.
  - Each one had longer rest time than the previous.
  - Good results from shaping, letting it rest/relax, then reshaping
- No excessive rising, dough not "bready"
- Two of the crusts were exactly what I wanted!
- Used rice flour for peel. Should use cornmeal, tastes better.
- Each cooked 5-7 minutes, no soggy or overcooked bottoms.
- Need more shaping practice. One was too thin in the center, another too thick in the center.


### 2025/01/24-25

#### Day 0

- 0910: start
- 0935: 1324g dough. 4 boules to fridge oiled and wrapped in plastic food bags, folded under, not tied.

#### Day 1

- 1650: boules to proofer @ 80F
- 1835: first pizza to oven. baked each 5-8m.

#### Notes

- Nailed it. Each pizza was great. 
- Much easier to shape than previously, none were dried out.
- Flavor and texture were much improved by the longer fridge time, and might be improved by even more fridge time.
- Room for improvement in shaping: only 2/4 were really round, and although all were "thin crust" some of them were uniform thickness instead of the desired thinner-at-the-middle.
- Used cheddar for some of the cheese on 2 of the pizzas. Authentic for NY pizza but adds a lot of grease.
- Would be nice to have more poofiness in the outer crust, but it was fine as it was
- Still not 14", each closer to 12"
- Cold, it seems the dough could be chewier. Next time, knead more - this will make it even harder to stretch tho

### 2025/02/12-14

#### Day 0

- 1805: start
- 1815: mix in mixer on 1, poured water into mixer instead of dry into water
- 1817: mix on 2
- 1828: 1320g
- 1833: four boules to fridge in individual containers

### 2025/03/05-07

#### Day 0

- 1835: start
- 1845: mix in mixer on 1. followed recipe, it's dumb. pour water dry.
- 1848: mixer 2
- 1905: to freezer, 332g each.

#### Day 1

> Sauce: muir glen organic whole peeled tomatoes, pureed with 1 tsp salt per 28oz tomatoes. between sauce and cheese: dry oregano, aleppo peppers

- 1700: boules to counter. room temp 17F
- 1800: pizza steel in, oven to Surround 525F
- 1900: pizza in

#### Notes

- 2 hour rest time was great! dough was easy to stretch.
- pizza steel makes a huge difference. crispy crust each time. 
- paused 15 minutes between second and third pizzas. the extra warmup time led to much crisper/blacker crust on the first and third.
- third pizza was hawaiian. with so many toppings after a 15m re-warmup, the bottom cooked much faster than the top. heavy topped pizzas should go second or fourth
- cheese was soupy/gooey
- cooked final pizza on convection broil, it was great but not better than the others
- sauce was a big hit! also added dried herbs on top after taking pizzas from oven. great move!
- 🚨 didn't dust peel enough, didn't shake test before insertion : cheese spillage 🚨

#### Next Time

> The main "defect" with these delicious pizzas was the soupy sauce. the crust was delicious but too crisp (on purpose) to be "new york style". for less crispy crust, use the pizza stone. for delicious almost crackery crust, use the steel. next time, get a firmer, chewier cheese, no soup.

- bake pizzas on higher rack to melt the cheese better - this is the primary change
- try to bake longer: 10m
- press moisture out of the cheese before grating
- strain some liquid out of the sauce or blend in some tomato paste
- use less/no fontina
- 🚨 use tons of semolina to dust peel, and wiggle test before insertion 🚨

### 2025/03/12

- used 565g water (71%)
- dough: 1393g, 4x348g

#### Notes

> Sauce: dinapoli crushed tomatoes, 28oz + 1tsp kosher salt. between sauce and cheese: dry oregano or italian herb blend, aleppo peppers

- 2 hour rest
- pizza steel
- oven rack 4
- oven setting: surround 525F (max), 1 hour preheat
- cooked about 8m each

- sauce was way better. hard to say if it's the brand or the crushedness vs puree. much deeper color than last time.
- fourth pizza was 9/10 mozzarella/cheddar, and was laid on thicker than the rest, but with sauce still visible. 
- fourth pizza was the closest yet to perfect cheese texture. 
- very crispy crust, but foldable. very thin at the center, almost unrisen.


#### Next Time

- minimum 8/10 mozzarella
- stick with denapoli crushed tomatoes
- use enough 8/10 mozzarella that no sauce is visible, and then some
- MORE CHEESE 🧀 🧀 🧀 🧀 🧀 
- keep rack at #4 - it's essential for topping-heavy pizza like hawaiian
- let it rest and cool
- sop up extra grease
- ⁉️ wetter dough -> thinner bottom crust. dryer dough -> thicker bottom crust 
- ⁉️ lower temp (475-500F instead of 525F) + steel for more NY-style crust

#### Long Term

- more tender less/same crispy crust
- determine if the sauce was great because it was denapoli brand or becuase it was crushed not pureed

### 2025/03/20

- BRM artisan bread flour
- used 565g water (71%)
- dough: 1393g, 4x348g
- 8m on #2

- dough was extremely wet. added no flour. very hard to work with, no proper boules.

#### Day 1

> ❗️ Unlike all previous, this dough spent only one night in the fridge, not 2. I think it's the best crust yet.

> Sauce: muir glen organic crushed fire roasted tomatoes, 28oz can + 1 tsp kosher salt. nice dark red color. 

> pizza 0: 217g mozz/cacciacovelli 80:20 plus extra to cover all sauce. Exactly what I was going for - the right amount (or a little too much) cheese, great but not overwhelming sauce, crust floppy until the chewy edge.
> pizza 1: mozz/swiss/fontina 60:35:5 and canned black olives. in at 525F. Even better than 0. swiss adds even more of the desired texture, at the cost of tasting like swiss cheese on a pizza. even chewier outer crust. took about 12-14 minutes. 

- 1710: dough out
- 1800: steel on rack 4, preheat 475F "surround"
- 1900: pizza on.
- 1919: crust not cooking. raised temp to 500F


- minimum 8/10 mozzarella
- use enough 8/10 mozzarella that no sauce is visible, and then some
- MORE CHEESE 🧀 🧀 🧀 🧀 🧀 
- keep rack at #4 - it's essential for topping-heavy pizza like hawaiian
- ⁉️ lower temp (475-500F instead of 525F) + steel for more NY-style crust


- pizzas are taking about 12m to bake

NEXT TIME

- dont proof high hydration dough so long - 1hr is fine
- MORE heat not less for high hydration dough
- try for puffier outer crust. less sauce there (not sufficient)? less proofing (likely)? less water? (maybe) handling (not fully sufficient)?
- make recipe note: use crushed tomatoes for a darker color/flavor, or puree whole for a lighter color/flavor

-> poofier crust: less stretching on knuckles, more shaping on peel. dont make it too big. LOWEWR HYDRATION, clower to 64%
-> dont make it too big because then it might not fit easily on the steel, and also, crust may not be very poofy

pizza 3 had the best crust of all, by far - so maybe keep the 2 hour proof, or increase it

-> do add trader joe's sun dried tomatoes between sauce and cheese
-> do use way more semolina than you want to
-> don't use much fontina, it brings the gooieness you don't like
-> do use way more oregano/italian herb blend than you think
-> want thicker bottom, more sauce, more herb flavor in the sauce

!!!! actually there was no swiss cheese

!!! next time: try swiss cheese
