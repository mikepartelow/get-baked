   3. mixture should foam and bubble
2. Mix flour, sugar, salt with a whisk in a large mixing bowl.
3. Add olive oil to the large mixing bowl.

12. Put in fridge for 18-24 hours.

### Day 1: Baking Day

1. "Punch down" the dough by turning it out onto a clean countertop and shaping it into a rough rectangle. Use knuckles to work out large gas bubbles.
2. Tightly roll the dough into a log 12 to 15 inches long. 
3. Cut log into thirds. 
4. [Optional] Moisten the counter with water to up the surface tension a bit so that the ball tightens up instead of sliding across the counter.
5. Shape each third into a disk, then shape the disks into smooth balls. 
6. Cover each ball with a clean kitchen towel and set aside for 30 minutes at room temperature.

## Things to try
- [ ] how to more uniformly incorporate the olive oil? kinda lumpy
- [ ] instant yeast
- [ ] letting dough proof a little before putting in fridge
