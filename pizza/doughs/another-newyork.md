## History

### 2025/04/09-11

#### Day 0

2000: MEP/mix
2010: rest 30m
2040: knead 5m
2045: rest 30m
21:25: 4 pizzas to fridge

#### Day 1

1700: dough out
1800: oven, with steel, to 525F "surround" mode
1900: first pizza in. fire roasted crushed tomatoes, mozz, pecorino, oregano. dough is bubbly, not very stretchy.

#### Notes
- used 1.75lbs trader joe's mozzarella for 4 pizzas
- compared to previous recipe: pizzas were smaller, much darker, much thicker (in a good way) rim, somewhat better structurally (less flop after fold), surprisingly less crispy on bottom (considering darker-ness on top), and absolutely delicious - undenibly the best yet
- pan pizza worked out great
- swiss cheese worked out great
- 6-8m total per pizza. one got to 9m and was a little burnt
- one XL bubble in each pizza. why? was it the top of the dough ball?
- fourth pie was tomatoes, oregano, cheese, oregano: plenty of oregano flavor
- while excellent, it was too darkened (too close to top of oven), too crispy, and too bubbly on the rim (didn't take sauce/cheese far enough out) to be "real NYC style"
- excellent cold pizza breakfast 
- turns out i used 100% TJ's part-skim mozz, not full fat!

#### Next time

- ‚ùóÔ∏è keep oven setting: 525F surround
- ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è pizza steel on 3rd, not 2nd, rack, for crispier bottom and less brown/more NYC crust ("7 inches from the top")
- ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è use 50/50 whole milk mozz and skim mozz
- more pan pizza. try the pan pizza recipe from same guy, and/or make a double boule and stretch it for the full pan.
- more swiss cheese
- oregano on top of cheese
- stick with fire roasted crushed tomatoes
- when shaping, leave thickness in the middle - shape towards the outside. then when tossing, stretch out the thick middle. stretch even bigger.
