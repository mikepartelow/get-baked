## History

### 2025/04/09-11

#### Day 0

2000: MEP/mix
2010: rest 30m
2040: knead 5m
2045: rest 30m
21:25: 4 pizzas to fridge

#### Day 1

1700: dough out
1800: oven, with steel, to 525F "surround" mode
1900: first pizza in. fire roasted crushed tomatoes, mozz, pecorino, oregano. dough is bubbly, not very stretchy.

#### Notes
- used 1.75lbs trader joe's mozzarella for 4 pizzas
- compared to previous recipe: pizzas were smaller, much darker, much thicker (in a good way) rim, somewhat better structurally (less flop after fold), surprisingly less crispy on bottom (considering darker-ness on top), and absolutely delicious - undenibly the best yet
- pan pizza worked out great
- swiss cheese worked out great
- 6-8m total per pizza. one got to 9m and was a little burnt
- one XL bubble in each pizza. why? was it the top of the dough ball?
- fourth pie was tomatoes, oregano, cheese, oregano: plenty of oregano flavor
- while excellent, it was too darkened (too close to top of oven), too crispy, and too bubbly on the rim (didn't take sauce/cheese far enough out) to be "real NYC style"
- excellent cold pizza breakfast 
- turns out i used 100% TJ's part-skim mozz, not full fat!

#### Next time

- ❗️ keep oven setting: 525F surround
- ❗️❗️❗️❗️ pizza steel on 3rd, not 2nd, rack, for crispier bottom and less brown/more NYC crust ("7 inches from the top")
- ❗️❗️❗️ use 50/50 whole milk mozz and skim mozz
- more pan pizza. try the pan pizza recipe from same guy, and/or make a double boule and stretch it for the full pan.
- more swiss cheese
- oregano on top of cheese
- stick with fire roasted crushed tomatoes
- when shaping, leave thickness in the middle - shape towards the outside. then when tossing, stretch out the thick middle. stretch even bigger.

### 2025/04/16-17

> KAF bread
> SAF instant

#### Day 0

- 1900: MEP/mix
- 1950: knead, shape, to fridge

#### Notes

- forgot to rest after knead

#### Day 1

> steel on 3rd row (labeled 4)
> "surround" mode 525F

- 1700: dough out
- the rest

#### Notes

- crust was absolutely perfect: chewy, crunchy, pleasantly burnt, airy
- a little too thick (not stretched enough) to be true NYC
- amazing though
- made a bar pizza and didn't stretch it enough but it was also great. baked 4ish minutes under the steel, then 4ish minutes on the steel (but in a 9x13 lloydpan)
- last pizza had extra extra cheese, and it was too much: clumped and slid off
- cheese was 1lb TJ's part skim mozz, .8lb full fat mozz, small amount of freshly shredded pecornino
- pepperoni could have been crisper
- 3 amazing, 4th was a little soupy -- extra cheese plus sundried tomato. too much extra cheese
- cooking on 3rd row, not 2nd, was perfect
- 6m bake time for the round pies.
- dough seemed more oily than last time, even though same recipe. however, pizza was amazing, so this is great.

#### Next time

- could change nothing (except don't over-cheese) - excellent as is
- could try for less charred crust 
    - not for flavor/texture, since this was great pizza, but for experience/control
    - use stone not steel
    - use bake mode not surround mode - no direct heat from above
- could try for a thinner, more authentic NYC crust: stretch a little more
- cautiously use less semolina - this dough, covered in flour, sticks less

#### Even if "changing nothing" try this for one or two pies

> Sog reduction:

- Drain the pizza sauce, less liquid. Crushed tomatoes are tinned with water.
 OR
- Use whole tomatoes. Discard the canning liquid, pulse in processor for 1-2 seconds
- Less cheese
