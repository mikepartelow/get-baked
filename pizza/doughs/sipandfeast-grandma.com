## History

### 2025/04/23-25

> used KAF bread flour

#### Day 0

- 1530: mix/MEP
- 1545: rest 30m
- 1615: knead
- 1630: 2 x 675g boules to fridge

#### Day 1

> Used 12x18" lloydpan and sur la table half sheet pan
> Oven: sliding shelf on 5 (of 6 - so not the actual top like recipe), fixed shelves on 1, 2
> Used crushed fire roasted tomatoes, drained. needed 1 large and one small can.

- 1710: MEP
- 1715: panned. 45m timer
- 1800: oven to 450F "convection bake". stretch doughs
- 1810: 45m timer
- 1900: first pizza in
- basically followed the instructions as written

#### Notes

- both pizzas were delicious but neither had a great crispy bottom
- prefer the texture of grated cheese
- forgot to salt the crushed tomatoes, didn't matter
- fire roasted crushed tomatoes were fine
- couldn't taste the garlic oil, but maybe it was a subtle foundation
- first pizza, on bottom with a rack directly above, rose into the rack and stuck to it. oops!
- crust was best around edges, less best in the center

#### Next time

- use steel for crispier crust
- forget about the second lower rack - just do bottom rack ‚ùóÔ∏è with steel ‚ùóÔ∏è and second top rack
- check bottom after 12m - if not browned, finish pizza on bottom, don't add second one yet
- since center crust was less best, maybe use a smaller pan? maybe bake longer? steel?
- try more cheese on part of one pie
